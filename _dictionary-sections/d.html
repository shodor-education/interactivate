items:
- term: "decimal"
  definition: "Short for the term \"decimal fraction\", a decimal is another way to represent fractional numbers.  The decimal uses place value to express the value of a number as opposed to a fraction that uses a numerator and denominator."
- term: "decimal number"
  definition: "A fraction where the denominator is a power of ten and is therefore expressed using a decimal point. For example: 0.37 is the decimal equivalent of 37/100"
- term: "degrees"
  definition: "A circle is measured in units called degrees. The entire circle is 360 degrees, half a circle is 180 degrees, and one quarter of a circle is 90 degrees. The \"L\" shaped 90 degree circle forms what is called a right angle. When examining circular objects, such as spinners, the size of each segment in the circle can be described in degrees"
- term: "denominator"
  definition: "In a rational number, the number below the fraction bar that indicates how many parts the whole is divided into."
- term: "discontinuous graph"
  definition: "A line in a graph that is interrupted, or has breaks in it forms a discontinuous graph"
- term: "disjoint events"
  definition: "Two events are disjoint if they can't both happen at the same time (in other words, if they have no outcomes in common). Equivalently, two events are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set"
- term: "distributive property"
  definition: "Summing two numbers and then multiplying by another number yields the same value as multiplying both values by the other value and then adding. In mathematical terms, for all real numbers a, b, and c, a(b+c) = ab+ac"
- term: "division"
  definition: "The inverse operation of multiplication"
- term: "domain of the function f"
  definition: "The set of numbers x for which f(x) is defined"
