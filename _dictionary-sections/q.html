Each of the four parts is called a \"quadrant\" and is designated by a roman numeral, I, II, III, or IV.  Quadrant I contains all coordinates with positive x and positive y values; Quadrant II contains all negative x and positive y values; Quadrant III contains all negative x and negative y values; and Quadrant IV contains all positive x and negative y values."
