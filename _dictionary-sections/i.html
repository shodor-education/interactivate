items:
- term: "identity"
  definition: "A number that when an operation is applied to a given number yields that given number. For multiplication, the identity is one and for addition the identity is zero"
- term: "indefinitely"
  definition: "An unspecified amount, having no exact limits"
- term: "independent events"
  definition: "Two events A and B are independent if the probability that they happen at the same time is the product of the probabilities that each occurs individually; i.e., if P(A &amp; B) = P(A)P(B). In other words, learning that one event occurs does not give any information about whether the other event occurred too: the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the unconditional probability of A, i.e., P(A/B) = P(A)"
- term: "infinity"
  definition: "Greater than any fixed counting number, or extending forever. No matter how large a number one thinks of, infinity is larger than it. Infinity has no limits"
- term: "initiator"
  definition: "A line-segment or figure that begins as the beginning geometric shape for a fractal. The initiator is then replaced by the generator for the fractal"
- term: "input"
  definition: "The number or value that is entered, for example, into a function machine. The number that goes into the machine is the input"
- term: "integer"
  definition: "Any positive or negative number (including zero) that does not include a fraction or decimal"
- term: "intercept"
  definition: "See x-intercept or y-intercept"
- term: "intersection of sets"
  definition: "The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements that all the sets have in common; in other words, all the elements contained in every one of the sets."
- term: "irregular fractals"
  definition: "Complex fractals whose dimension is often difficult to determine and in some cases is unknown"
- term: "isosceles triangle"
  definition: "A triangle that has at least two congruent sides"
- term: "item"
  definition: "The things or objects that are the subject of a bar graph"
- term: "iteration"
  definition: "Repeating a set of rules or steps over and over. One step is called an iterate"
