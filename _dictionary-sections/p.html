items:
- term: "palindrome"
  definition: "Words, numbers, and phrases that can be read the same backwards as forwards. Some examples include: \"mom\", \"racecar\", \"34543\", or the phrase \"never odd or even\""
- term: "paradox"
  definition: "A statement that appears to contradict itself, for example, suggesting a solution which is actually impossible"
- term: "parallel"
  definition: "Lines that are in the same plane that do not intersect"
- term: "parallelogram"
  definition: "A quadrilateral that contains two pairs of parallel sides"
- term: "pattern"
  definition: "Characteristic(s) observed in one item that may be repeated in similar or identical manners in other items"
- term: "percent"
  definition: "A ratio that compares a number to one hundred. The symbol for percent is %"
- term: "perimeter"
  definition: "The sum of the lengths of all the sides of a polygon"
- term: "permutation"
  definition: "A a particular ordering of a set of objects. For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, there are six permutations: {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, and {3, 2, 1}"
- term: "personal view"
  definition: "An approach taken by mathematicians and philosophers to calculate probability. Using their knowledge and reasoning skills, they think through the problem. See theories of probability"
- term: "Petal Curve"
  definition: "See Rose Curve"
- term: "Pi"
  definition: "The designated name for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, represented by the symbol &pi;"
- term: "pie graph"
  definition: "A diagram showing a system of connections or interrelations between two or more things by using a circle divided into segments that look like pieces of pie"
- term: "polar axis"
  definition: "in the polar coordinate system, a ray from the pole in a fixed direction, analogous to the x-axis in the Cartesian system.  The angle between this fixed ray and a ray through the pole and the point of interest gives the value of theta in the coordinate pair (r, &theta;) used in the polar coordinate system."
- term: "pole"
  definition: "in the polar coordinate system, a fixed point, analogous to the origin in the Cartesian coordinate system.  The distance from this point to a point of interest gives the value of r in the coordinate pair (r, &theta;) used in the polar coordinate system."
- term: "polygon"
  definition: "A closed plane figure formed by three or more line segments that do not cross over each other"
- term: "polyhedra"
  definition: "Any solid figure with an outer surface composed of polygon faces"
- term: "prime number"
  definition: "A number that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself"
- term: "prisoners"
  definition: "A complex number is a prisoner in a Julia Set if its orbit, a sequence of complex numbers generated by successive iterations of a given function, is bounded."
- term: "probability"
  definition: "The measure of how likely it is for an event to occur. The probability of an event is always a number between zero and 100%. The meaning (interpretation) of probability is the subject of theories of probability. However, any rule for assigning probabilities to events has to satisfy the axioms of probability"
- term: "proportion"
  definition: "A relationship between two ratios is proportional if the two ratios are equal in value."
- term: "protractor"
  definition: "An instrument used to measure and draw angles on a flat surface."
- term: "Pythagorean Theorem"
  definition: "Used to find side lengths of right triangles, the Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the two sides, or A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>, where C is the hypotenuse"
