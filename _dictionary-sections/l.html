items:
- term: "Limacon"
  definition: "The resulting graph in polar coordinates of a function of the form a+b*sin(t) or a+b*cos(t) where |a| &ne; |b|"
- term: "limit"
  definition: "The target value that terms in a sequence of numbers are getting closer to. This limit is not necessarily ever reached; the numbers in the sequence eventually get arbitrarily close to the limit"
- term: "line"
  definition: "A continuous extent of length containing two or more points"
- term: "line graph"
  definition: "A diagram showing a system of connections or interrelations between two or more things by using lines"
- term: "line of best fit"
  definition: "A straight line used as a best approximation of a summary of all the points in a scatter-plot. The position and slope of the line are determined by the amount of correlation between the two, paired variables involved in generating the scatter-plot. This line can be used to make predictions about the value of one of the paired variables if only the other value in the pair is known."
- term: "line segment"
  definition: "A piece of a line with endpoints at both ends"
- term: "line symmetry"
  definition: "If a figure can be divided by a line where both divisions are mirrors of each other, the figure has line symmetry. The line that divides the figure is the <b>line of symmetry</b>"
- term: "linear"
  definition: "An equation or graph is linear if the graph of the equation is a straight line"
- term: "linear function"
  definition: "A function of the form f(x) = mx + b where m and b are some fixed numbers. The names \"m\" and \"b\" are traditional. Functions of this kind are called \"linear\" because their graphs are straight lines"
- term: "linear regression"
  definition: "An attempt to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered as the independent variable, and the other is considered as the dependent variable."
- term: "logarithm"
  definition: "The exponent of the power to which a base number must be raised to equal a given number. An example: 2 is the logarithm of 100 to the base 10. One can look at this way: 10 * 10 = 100, which is the same as 10<sup>2</sup>, and 2 is the exponent referred to above"
