      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I understand how to add and subtract fractions, but multiplying and dividing seems different.
      How is it done?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We'll start with multiplying. It is a little bit more straight-forward. Simply multiply the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">numerator</a> and multiply the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">denominator</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve 2/3 x 3/4
    </p>
    <p>
      multiply the numerators 2 and 3 (which will be 6)
    </p>
    <p>
      and then the denominators 3 and 4 (which will be 12)
    </p>
    <p>
      so 2/3 x 3/4 = 6/12
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> And I already learned that I can reduce that fraction to 1/2 by dividing both numbers by 6.
      How does it work when I divide numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's try it with the problem 2/7 divided by 2/5. There are several ways to look at this, but
      one way is to invert the fraction doing the dividing, and then multiply the numbers across.
      Invert means to turn upside down, so the steps of the problem look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="noBullets">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Step 1: 2/7 divided by 2/5
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 2: inverting 2/5 makes it 2/7 x 5/2
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 3: multiplying makes it 10/14
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 4: reducing makes it 5/7
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so 2/7 divided by 2/5 equals 5/7.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now try this one: 1/3 divided by 6/7.
    </p>
    <p />
