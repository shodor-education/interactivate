<p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Just what is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">self-similarity</a>?? Is it when you repeat the same steps over and over, like in
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">iteration</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">recursion</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is related to that. However, iteration and recursion describe the process of repeating
      steps. Self-similarity is a property of the object, not of the steps used to build the object.
      Think of it this way: When we look at stage 2 of the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/HilbertCurve' | relative_url }}">Hilbert Curve</a>, we can find a copy of stage 1:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image216.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      This copy is a smaller scale version of the original. We can find this in the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/KochSnowflake' | relative_url }}">Koch's Snowflake</a> , too:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image217.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you find self-similarity in the other fractals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I see it in zooming on the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tortoise' | relative_url }}">Tortoise and the Hare</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/AnotherHilbertCurve' | relative_url }}">Another Hilbert Curve</a>. I'm still having trouble understanding why self-similarity is different from iteration and
      recursion, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is difficult to explain. Now that you understand what self-similarity is, it may help to
      think of it this way: iteration and recursion frequently result in self-similar objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So, the Hilbert Curve is a self-similar object, but the way we construct it is an iterative
      process. I think I understand, now.
