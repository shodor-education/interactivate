      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> When we use a die for a game, we want the die to be
      <strong>fair</strong>. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It means that your chances of getting each number on the die are the same. No one number is
      more likely to be chosen than any other number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Each number is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">equally likely</a> to be chosen. Suppose two players use a six-sided die that has the sides numbered 1,1,2,2,3
      and 4. There are four numbers that can come up (1, 2, 3, and 4). Is the game fair if the first
      player wins when 1 or 2 shows, and the second player wins if 3 or 4 shows?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No way! The first player will almost always win.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Even though each player has two winning numbers, these numbers are not equally likely! Can you
      come up with more examples of games where numbers are or aren't equally likely to be chosen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Students and mentor come up with examples.
