      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What does it mean for a graph to be impossible? After all, it is just an abstract picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A graph is an abstract picture which represents something in reality so a graph cannot
      represent something in reality which cannot exist or happen. For example the following graph
      would be impossible because it shows negative mass:

      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ImpossibleGraphs-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> I can make another graph that would be impossible for many situations in the real world. If
      there is a graph of distance vs. time, it can't have gaps, because distance can only change
      continuously with time. In this graph, the distance changes instantaneously by too large an
      amount:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ImpossibleGraphs-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's true! We can distinguish between
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">continuous graph</a> which you could draw without ever lifting your pencil, and a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">discontinuous graph</a> which may have gaps, as long as it has one and only one y-value for each x-value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you tell me why this graph is impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ImpossibleGraphs-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because the graph shows time moving backwards..
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. As you can see, to decide whether each graph is possible or not, we mostly need
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It also helps to know the laws!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's true. Knowing the laws could never hurt.
