      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> I thought we were studying
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractions</a> now, so what do fractions have to do with a carton of eggs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Suppose we were mixing up a batch of blueberry muffins and the recipe called for four eggs.
      How would we represent four of the eggs in the carton as a fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, twelve eggs come in a carton, so the fraction would be 4/12, or four parts out of
      twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. And if we look in the carton after we take out the eggs, we see an example of what four
      out of twelve looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> And if we remove two more eggs, we see what six out of twelve, or 6/12 eggs looks like.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Yes, six out of twelve is exactly half of the eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. We can reduce the fraction 6/12 to one half, or 1/2. These two fractions are
      the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Can we reduce the fraction 4/12?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In the same way that six is half of twelve, or 1/2, four is one third of twelve, or 1/3. Both
      numbers can be divided by four: 4 divided by 4 is 1; 12 divided by 4 is 3, so the fraction is
      1/3.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> What fraction is it if we remove all the eggs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> There would be no eggs left, 0/12, or zero, so there wouldn't be a fraction, because there
      cannot be a part of nothing, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good thinking. Nothing is always nothing, so we can't remove some of it, or divide it into
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Then what if we didn't take out any parts at all; what if we left all the eggs in the carton?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The fraction would be 12/12, which would be the same as ...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> One. Twelve out of twelve eggs equals one entire carton of eggs. Any fraction that has the
      same
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">numerator</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">denominator</a> equals the number 1.

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> OK, I understand that now. I'm ready to make blueberry muffins!
