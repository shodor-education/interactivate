      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Here is one more game to play and study. Players roll 3 four-sided dice. Player 1 wins if the
      sum of the dice numbers is 3, 4, 5, 6 or 12; Player 2 wins if the sum is 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. Is
      the game fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Now I know that there are many possible ways to get the same sum. We used tables to count the
      possibilities for two dice. We can't use the table anymore, because it only has two... what do
      you call them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Dimensions. We can make a table with three dimensions or more, but it will be hard to use by
      hand. By the way, computers can deal with tables of hundreds of dimensions. What else can we
      do? Let me write the first quarter of the list of all the combinations, the part where the
      first die shows 1. It will be a boring task....

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Could we somehow get rid of all the repetitions? I mean, can we write one big fat "1" instead
      of sixteen little 1's?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why not? If we do that, we will obtain a structure called
      <em>a tree</em>. Can you guess why even before we make the pictures? Here is the picture that shows how this
      part of the tree for our problem is constructed. There will be 3 more parts for the rest of
      the possible numbers on the first die. You can build them yourself.

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do you see why it is called a tree?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because it looks like a tree lying on its side. We can add some "leaves" and write stuff on
      them. I will write the sum of the dice numbers:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure-discussion-10.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do you see how the tree can help us count outcomes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it is useful for counting the total number of outcomes. There are four "trunks" (for
      the possible numbers on the first die), and each has four "branches" (for the possible numbers
      on the second die), and each has four "twigs" (for the possible numbers on the third die). An
      outcome is formed as we go from a trunk to a brunch to a twig. There are as many outcomes as
      there are twigs: 4*4*4=64. Wow! It sounds like an old puzzle!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now look at all the "leaves" and find out if the game is fair. What is the probability of
      each player winning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Player 1 only has a winning probability of 21/64, whereas Player 2 has a winning probability
      of 43/64. This game is not fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How many possible outcomes are there if you have three coins? (2*2*2=8) If you have a coin
      and two six-sided dice? (2*6*6=72) How many outcomes are there if you have four
      coins?(2*2*2*2=16) Five six-sided dice(6*6*6*6*6)? By the way, if I do not feel like writing
      the numbers so many times, can I write the same thing much shorter: 6*6*6*6*6=6
      <sup> 5 </sup> It reads: "Six to the power of five." Computer folks type it as 6^5, because it is faster
      than switching to the superscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I do not want to actually draw all these huge trees!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A tree for the four coin problem would not be all that bad. Can you draw it? Observe that at
      each time the tree "branches," there are exactly two branches (for heads and tails on the next
      coin). Trees of that sort are called
      <em>binary trees</em>. They are very common in computational science, and even in nature:
      <div class="h-center">

      </div>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Here is a riddle for you. If we have a full binary tree (no branches are cut off) that has 8
      smallest branches, how many "levels of branching in two" are there? In other words, if we were
      playing with coins, how many coins would you need to produce 8 outcomes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let us see. The last branching happens when 4 branches became 8:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure-discussion-12.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div> The branching before that happens when 2 branches become 4:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure-discussion-13.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div> and the very first one is when a single branch becomes 2:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure-discussion-14.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div> So we have three levels of branching.
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> When you find out the number of branchings from the number of the last branches, it is called
      a computing logarithm, and the number of branchings is called a
      <strong>logarithm</strong>. There is a special sign for it:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure-discussion-15.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the original example with 3 four-sided dice, there were 64 "smallest branches," but each
      branching was splitting in four. That means:
      <strong>log4 64=3</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, and
      <strong> 4^3=64</strong>. By the way, where else have you seen trees like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In NCAA tournaments!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now you can easily translate the following question into mathematical language: "If there are
      64 teams in a tournament, how many rounds do they need to play to determine a winner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The question is so much shorter in math language!
      <strong>log2 64=? </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> The answer is 6.
    </p>
