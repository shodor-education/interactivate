      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Does anyone recall or know what we call it when 2 lines run side-by-side and never cross?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. Lines like that are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallel</a> lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! We've already learned that quadrilaterals have how many sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Four.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right and we call quadrilaterals with parallel sides
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallelograms</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But, how can all the sides be parallel if a quadrilateral is a polygon and is all closed off?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great thinking! I guess what I should have said is that a parallelogram has two pairs of
      opposite sides that are parallel, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Parallelograms-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, so the top is parallel to the bottom and the sides are parallel to each other. I
      understand now!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now I want to tell you about a special kind of parallelogram. It's called a rhombus. A
      rhombus is a parallelogram, but all four sides have the same length.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So a rhombus is a type of parallelogram just like a banana is a type of fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, we should not say that all parallelograms are rhombii, just like we don't say that all
      fruits are bananas.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think I understand what parallelograms and rhombii are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Wonderful! Now we can talk about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/Rectangles' | relative_url }}">rectangles</a>!
