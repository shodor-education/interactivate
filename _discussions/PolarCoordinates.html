      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are probably familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system which allows you to plot
      points and functions on the coordinate plane. If you are given a set of points in the form (x,
      y), you should be able to plot them on the x- and y-axes of a graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. If I were given the point (2,3), I would start at the origin and go two units to the
      right on the x-axis and then move up 3 units in the y direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is correct. And if you were given a function, say y=2x+3, you could probably graph that
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Of course, I would choose values of x which I would input into the function to get the values
      of y for that function. Then I would graph the points on the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! Did you know that you can also plot points on another type of graph based on the Polar
      Coordinate system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is the Polar Coordinate system?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The polar coordinate system is a circular rather than a rectangular coordinate system. You
      plot points given in terms of a value, r which is the distance from the center; and an angle
      measure which is given in degrees, or more usually radians. Do you remember what radians are?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure, they are another unit of measure for measuring angles. A circle contains 360 degrees
      which is the same as 2&pi; radians. But, what would you use this system for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well sometimes it is more appropriate to describe a location in terms of a circular motion
      rather than a straight line. This system is well suited to trigonometric functions and is used
      in navigation because values can be plotted in terms of distance (r) and direction (angle,
      also referred to as the Greek letter theta shown as the symbol &theta;).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How would you plot points on a polar graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The polar coordinate system has axes similar to the Cartesian system and a point like the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">origin</a> except that it is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">pole</a>. It also has a ray that extends horizontally through the pole called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">polar axis</a>. Instead of a square grid, there are concentric circles centered at the pole that get
      uniformly bigger and radiate out from the pole. Polar coordinate plane looks like this:
    </p>
    <p class="h-center">
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PolarCoordinates-discussion-1.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Like rectangular coordinates, polar coordinates are also named with an ordered pair, but the
      meaning of each of the numbers is different. The first number in the coordinate pair, r,
      represents the distance from the pole and is like measuring the radius of a circle. The second
      number of the pair, &theta;, represents the angle measure, measured from the horizontal axis.
      The polar axis represents an angle measure of 0 radians or 0 degrees. Moving counterclockwise
      from this axis represents a positive angle measure and clockwise is negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think I'm getting it. Angles are defined on the polar coordinate system the way they are on
      the unit circle, usually in radians. So, if you are given the polar coordinate (3, &pi;/4),
      the point is three units from the center with an angle of &pi;/4 radians measured
      counterclockwise from the polar axis:
    </p>
    <p class="h-center">
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PolarCoordinates-discussion-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So it sounds like coordinates given can be negative too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is an excellent question and the answer is yes. Just as on the unit circle, negative
      angles go in a clockwise direction from the polar axis. Do you remember -3&pi;/4 is the same
      as 5&pi;/4?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes and -4&pi;/3 is the same as 2&pi;/3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. And, since you can add as many rotations in the form of multiples of 2Ï€ as you
      want, any angle can have an infinite amount of negative and positive values. In addition, r
      can be negative. A negative r indicates that the point is in the opposite
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/q' | relative_url }}">quadrant</a> from the angle given in the coordinate pair. For example &pi;/4 is located in the 1st
      quadrant, so positive r values are plotted r units from the pole in the 1st quadrant and
      negative values are plotted in the opposite quadrant, the 3rd quadrant, on the angle
      identified as 5&pi;/4. Where do you think the point (-2, &pi;/3) is plotted?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, since (2, &pi;/4) was measured 2 units to the right along the polar axis, then -2 would
      indicate that the point is measured 2 units to the left along the polar axis and then &pi;/4
      degrees in the counterclockwise direction. Since the angle &pi;/3 is in the first quadrant,
      then to plot the point (-2, &pi;/3) you would plot a point two units from the pole along the
      angle 4&pi;/3. Right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. It would look like this:
    </p>
    <p class="h-center">
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PolarCoordinates-discussion-3.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So a single point could have many different values?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! The values for r can be given as positive and negative values and &theta; can be
      given not only in positive and negative values, but also as any value &theta; + any multiple
      of 2&pi;. So, unlike the Cartesian system where each point has a unique set of coordinates, in
      the polar system any point can have an infinite number of coordinates!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That means that the point given as (2,&pi;/4) could also be given as (2,-7&pi;/4) or (2,
      9&pi;/4) or (-2,5&pi;/4)!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Try plotting those points using the Polar Coordinates activity and verify they are
      the same point!
    </p>
