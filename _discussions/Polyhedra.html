      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you make a fair die that has 3 sides? If you can, how? If you can't, why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What about this one:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/Polyhedra-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      You can construct it from three pieces of paper, gluing or taping the edges together:

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What other dice can you make this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I guess I can make one with 4 sides. And with 5 sides. And... using code; Wait a minute! I
      can make a die with any number of sides this way! It will look like a blimp!
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/Polyhedra-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Any number? What about 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes! It would be like a coin. But I can't do a
      <strong>1-sided</strong> die this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, but if you wanted a one-sided die you could make one or find one around you. What can you
      think of that has only one side?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A M&ouml;bius strip!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Or a sphere. A marble is a one-sided die.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But you can't make a marble out of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What if I told you that we can only use unbending cardboard? Also, each side has to be a
      figure with straight edges of the same length, and with the same angles (such figures are
      called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">regular polygons</a>). In other words, the die should be of the same type as the usual six-sided dice. Can you
      make a three-sided die this way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why? What about a die with 4 sides? With 5 sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there are only five types of dice (or
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">polyhedra</a>) that can be built this way.
