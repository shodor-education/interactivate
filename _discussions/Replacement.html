      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us start by defining our game. We'll consider a bag of marbles. In this bag there are two
      different colors of marbles, red and blue. In our example we'll say that there are 4 red and 4
      blue. We will take two marbles out of the bag without looking inside, and when we look at the
      first one we find that it is red. What are the chances, theoretically speaking, that the
      second one is also red?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, that's pretty easy. We know that there are 4 of each color marble and 8 in the bag, so
      there is a
      <strong> 4/8 </strong> chance that we'll draw a red -- hey that's 1/2! -- and another
      <strong> 1/2</strong> chance that we'll draw another red. So the probability of both happening is
      <strong>1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> But wait a minute. If we draw 1 red marble out doesn't that mean that there are just 7
      marbles left in the bag, only 3 of which are red marbles? Wouldn't this make our new
      probability be
      <strong>1/2 * 3/7 = 3/14</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We have two different answers! Maybe the problem is not as simple as it at first appeared to
      be. Let us look at several easier problems and then return to The Marble Bag later.

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This whole question hinges on a term called
      <strong>replacement</strong>. Both of you are exactly right, but it depends on the way you view the problem. Let's look at
      an easier problem. Let's say that we have just 4 marbles in the bag, 2 red and 2 blue. The
      likelihood of drawing a red is 1/2. Now for a moment let's say we didn't put the marble that
      we just drew, back into the bag. So how many total marbles do we have after pulling the first
      red out?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> There are 3 total marbles in the bag if you don't put the red one back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is the probability of drawing another red if we don't replace the one we've already
      drawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Then it would be 1/2*1/3 which is
      <strong>1/6</strong> wouldn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> That would be because there are only three marbles left. So my answer to the first question
      was correct then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes if you choose to look at it that way. Let's go back to our simpler problem of 4 marbles.
      What if we replace the marble that we have just drawn. We've already established that the
      probability of drawing one red is 1/2. Now what is the probability of drawing another red if
      we choose to replace the marble that we have just drawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Then it would be like I said in my answer to the first problem. The probability of drawing
      another red marble would be 1/2, just like the first time we drew. So the probability of
      drawing two red ones would be 1/2*1/2 or
      <strong>1/4</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, it all depends on whether or not we replace the marble or item that we have just
      withdrawn from the bag. Everytime we have a probability question like this -- choosing
      multiple objects out of the same set -- we have to decide whether we have replacement or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process of choosing objects like marbles out of containers like bags to determine what
      the contents of the bag look like is called
      <strong>sampling</strong>, so we have been talking about
      <strong>sampling with and without replacement</strong>!
