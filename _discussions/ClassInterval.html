      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Histogram' | relative_url }}">Histogram Activity</a>, I saw that the same data set can look different if I change scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Isn't it amazing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Not really. I can easily make up an example and explain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I would like to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Here, if we have yearly crime reports for six years with 3, 6, 6, 2, 3 and 4 crimes a year,
      with
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">class interval</a> sizes of one year the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">bar graph</a> looks this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ClassInterval-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So we can see that the crime rate was going up for the last three years. However, if we
      choose class intervals of two years, the impression from the bar graph is that the crime rate
      was going down all the time:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ClassInterval-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I see how it happens: smaller class interval sizes show more exact picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In bar graphs, we usually talk about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">items</a> rather than class intervals. In your example, "items" were years in the first picture and
      two-year periods in the second picture. In
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">histograms</a>, sometimes you can change class interval sizes just a little and change the impression a lot.
      Can you make an example of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> If there are several values close to the boundary of one interval, you can move the boundary
      a little and the values will "jump" into the next class. For example, I want to build
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/HistogramsVsBarGraph' | relative_url }}">a histogram (not a bar graph)</a> of daily temperatures. If the temperature values are 2, 3, 2, 2.5, 3, 2.5, 2.5 and the class
      intervals (starting from 0) are of the length 2.6, then the first class interval has 5 values
      and the second class interval has 2 values. However, if we change the interval length to 2.4,
      the first interval has 2 values and the second one 5 values!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> What happens if we set the interval length to exactly 2.5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It depends on the so-called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">end point convention</a>. You can decide to count values that are on the exact boundary between two intervals either
      in the left or in the right interval. Whatever you decide, you better announce your decision
      to people who are going to read your histogram!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think you should also stick to your end point convention for all intervals in one
      histogram.
