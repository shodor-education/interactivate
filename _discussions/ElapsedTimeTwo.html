      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Consider this problem: "We started our math lesson at 10 a.m., and I expect it to last for 2
      hours. When will it end?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 12 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! Now let's think about our vocabulary words. What do we call 10 a.m.?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's our starting time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, so what is the 2 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">elapsed time</a>! We learned that in the last lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. So what do we call the time we were trying to figure out?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 12 p.m.? That's the ending time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! How do you think we calculate ending time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Probably like we calculate elapsed time. Either we could think of it as a regular addition
      problem, being careful not to have more than 60 minutes. Or we could split the elapsed time
      into groups, first adding the hours, then the minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What do you do if you get more than 60 minutes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When you get to 60, you add another hour and set the minutes at zero, and then keep adding
      from there. So when you have 75 minutes, that's the same as 1 hour 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! Now you're ready for some really tricky problems.
    </p>
