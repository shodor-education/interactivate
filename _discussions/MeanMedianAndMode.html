      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When do we use mean and when do we use median?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is up to the researcher to decide. The important thing is to make sure you tell which
      method you use. Unfortunately, too often people call mean, median and mode by the same name:
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">average</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mode</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The easiest way to look at modes is on
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">histograms</a>. Let us imagine a histogram with the smallest possible
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">class intervals</a> (see also
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/VerticalScaleDiscuss' | relative_url }}">Increase or Decrease? Discussion</a> ).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then every different piece of data contributes to only one bin in the histogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now let us consider the value that repeats most often. It will look like the highest peak on
      our histogram. This value is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mode</a>. A histogram would have no mode if all the data points occur the same number of times. If
      there are several modes, data is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">multimodal</a>. Can you make an example of trimodal data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Data with three modes? Sure. Say, if somebody counted numbers of eggs in 20 tree creepers'
      nests, they could get these numbers: 4, 3, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 3, 6, 4, 6, 4, 2,
      6. I can make a histogram:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image212.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are three values that appear most often: 3, 4, and 6, so all these values are modes.
      Modes are often used for so-called
      <strong>qualitative</strong> data, that is, data that describes qualities rather than quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">median</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>
      <strong>Median</strong> is simply the middle piece of data, after you have sorted data from the smallest to the
      largest. In other words, the median is the number that splits the sorted data into two sets
      that are equal in the number of data values. For example, the median of the data set 1, 3, 6,
      8, 9 would be 6 since two numbers are to the left of 6 and two numbers are to the right of 6.
      But the median of the data set 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 would be the average of 6 and 7, or (6+7)/2 =
      6.5, since a set with an even number of data values doesn't really have a middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What happens when the data contains duplicates, like the eggs in the nests example?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In your nest example, you sort the numbers first: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,
      5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 eggs. There is an even number of values, so the middle (or median) is between
      the first and second 4 (the 10th and 11th values). Because they are the same, their average is
      also 4, so the median is 4. What would the median be if we had 19 nests instead of 20 and the
      missing nest was the one with a single egg in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In that case, the sorted data would be 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6,
      6 and the median would be the 10th number which is the second 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Excellent!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The last type of averages I would like to know about is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mean</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sometimes it is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">arithmetic mean</a>, because there are other things in math that are called mean. For example, there is a
      geometric mean and a harmonic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of values is a sum of all
      values, divided by their number. In your nest example,
    </p>
    <p>
      mean = (4+3+1+2+6+3+4+5+2+6+4+3+3+3+6+4+6+4+2+6)/20 = 3.85
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Which one is better: mean, median or mode?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It depends on your goals. I can give you some examples to show you why. Consider a company
      that has nine employees with salaries of 35,000 a year, and their supervisor makes 150,000 a
      year. If you want to describe the typical salary in the company, which statistics will you
      use?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I will use mode (35,000), because it tells what salary
      <strong>most</strong> people get.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What if you are a recruiting officer for the company that wants to make a good impression on
      a prospective employee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The mean is (35,000*9 + 150,000)/10 = 46,500 I would probably say: "The average salary in our
      company is 46,500" using mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In each case, you have to decide for yourself which statistics to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It also helps to know which ones other people are using!
    </p>
