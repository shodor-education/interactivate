      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Today we are going to learn about angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know what an angle is! It is two
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">rays</a> connected together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! Did you read that from your book?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, there are three categories of angles:
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">acute</a>,
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">obtuse</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">right</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's learn what a right angle is first. Right angles are present many places in real life.
      Look at the corners of this room or the edges of your books. A right angle is an angle that
      measures 90 degrees. A right angle looks like this:

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The second type of angle is acute. An acute angle is an angle whose measure is between 0 and
      90 degrees. An acute angle looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let me guess! The third type is an angle whose measure is more than 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, an obtuse angle is an angle whose measure is between 90 and 180 degrees. An obtuse angle
      looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We also have names for pairs of angles. Angles are formed when lines intersect. We are going
      to look at the angles formed when two
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallel</a> lines are intersected by a third line called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">transversal</a> . In this picture, the red lines are parallel and the blue line is the transversal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Those lines formed 8 angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job. Now, who can show me an acute angle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can! It is the one on the top right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right again. Who can show me an obtuse angle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I think it is the one on the top left.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct. We need an easier way of referring to the angles we are talking about. So from now
      on, we will label our angles. Angles a and b are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">adjacent angles</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-7.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Angles f and h are also adjacent angles. Does anyone know what it means for a pair of angles
      to be adjacent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Does it mean that they are side by side?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, adjacent angles are angles that share a ray. Can anyone tell me another pair of angles
      that are adjacent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, angles c and d are adjacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I can too; angles b and d are adjacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job, angles c and d are adjacent and so are angles b and d. There are many pairs of
      adjacent angles in the picture. Now, let's talk about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">vertical angles</a>. Angles a and d are vertical angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-8.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Angles f and g are also vertical angles. Can anyone guess what it means for a pair of angles
      to be vertical?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are vertical angles ones that are opposite from each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! Vertical angles share only one point. That point is called the vertex. Can anyone
      name another pair of vertical angles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I can; angles b and c are vertical angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Angles e and h are also vertical angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, angles b and c are vertical angles and so are angles e and h. Now that we know what
      adjacent and vertical angles are, let's talk about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">alternate interior angles</a>. Angles c and f are alternate interior angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-9.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Angles d and e are also alternate interior angles. Who knows what it means for two angles to
      be alternate interior angles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are alternate interior angles the ones that are inside the lines and on opposite sides from
      each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, alternate interior angles are angles that are inside the parallel lines and on opposite
      sides of the transversal. Now, who thinks they can guess what
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">alternate exterior angles</a> are?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They are the angles on the outsides of the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the
      transversal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct again. Who can give me an example?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Angles a and h are alternate exterior angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Angles-discussion-10.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Angles b and g are also alternate exterior angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job. It's time for the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Angles' | relative_url }}">angles game</a> .
    </p>
