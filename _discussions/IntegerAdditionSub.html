      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now that we have established a definition for the Integers, we can perform operations on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What kind of "operations"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, the easiest one would be
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">addition</a>. Consider this example: a friend gives you 3 pieces of candy. If you already had 2 pieces of
      candy, then how many pieces would you have?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If I had two pieces and was given three more, then I would have 5 pieces of candy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, that is right. You just added two integers. Now, to express this operation we would
      write, 2 + 3 = 5, which represents 2 pieces of candy plus (or in addition to) 3 pieces of
      candy equals 5 pieces of candy. Now what if you had three pieces of candy and someone gave you
      two more?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hmm, if I had 3 pieces and someone gave me 2 more, then I would end up with 5 pieces of
      candy, again. So if 2 + 3 = 5 and 3 + 2 = 5, then does 2 + 3 = 3 + 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, in fact, for any two integers b and c, b + c = c + b. You can add them in either order,
      we call this the Commutative Law of Addition. Also, if you are addding more than two numbers,
      you may add them in any order you like, i.e. if you were adding b + c + d, then you could
      first add b to c, (b + c) + d, or you could first add c to d, b + (c + d). We call this the
      Associative Law of Addition (parentheses are used to emphasize the order of the operations
      performed).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The Integers also inlude the Negative Numbers, right? What happens when you add a positive
      number to a negative number, or two negative numbers together?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's say we had two positive numbers b and c. Then b + (-c) would be the same as
      writing b - c, or b minus c. We call this
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">subtraction</a>. Let's return to our candy example for a moment. What if you started off with 5 pieces of
      candy and then someone took away 2 pieces?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If I had 5 pieces and someone took away 2 pieces I would have 3 pieces left. So 5 - 2 = 3,
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, however, it is important to know that 5 - 2 is not the same as 2 - 5. To subtract a
      larger number from a smaller number simply start with the smaller number and count down. Once
      you hit zero, the next number will be -1, then -2, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So to figure out what 2 - 5 equals I would count down five numbers from 2: 1, 0, -1, -2, -3.
      So 2 - 5 = -3, which is definitely not equal to 5 - 2 = 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You certainly seem to understand addition and subtraction. Notice that if you subtracted b
      units from b you would end up back at zero. For any number b, b - b = 0. Now I have one last
      question. What do you think would happen if you added or subtracted 0 from a number?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well if you did not add anything to a number, it wouldn't change, so b + 0 = b if b is any
      integer. The same would be true if you did not subtract anything from a number, so b - 0 = b.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Yes, and since adding or subtracting 0 from any number changes nothing, we can drop it out of
      the computation completely. This leaves us with b = b, for any b, which we call the identity
      equation. It tells us that any number b is always equal to itself.
    </p>
