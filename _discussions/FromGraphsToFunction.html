      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Function machines involve an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">input</a> value and an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">output</a> value. I have a function machine without a formula or a description. There is something else
      here that is supposed to tell me how the machine works. It looks like a line on a grid. If you
      give me a number to put into the machine, I will use this line as my function machine to find
      out what number comes out.

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Use 3 as input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> My pleasure. I just count 3 steps to the right from zero. Then I go vertically (straight up
      or down) up to the line, counting steps. Here, I go up: One, two, three, four steps. 4 is the
      number that this function produces out of 3!
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Can I try it? I want to put 1 into the function machine. I start from zero, make one step to
      the right, then go straight up counting the steps: One, two. So the function produces 2 when
      you put 1 into it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Do you ever go to the left of zero?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sure. The numbers for steps to the left of zero are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">negative numbers</a>. We put a small minus sign in front of a number to show that it is to the left of zero, or
      negative. Likewise, we use a minus sign to mean "down." Who wants to try the machine on
      negative numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I want to put -5 into the machine. I go five steps to the left from zero, then up... no wait,
      down to the line: One, two, three, four steps down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">function</a> produces -4 when the input is -5.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know exactly what the machine does! It adds 1 to the input numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The line told you that! This line, called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/g' | relative_url }}">graph</a>, is just another way of explaining what the function does. Would you like to try another
      "line-as-machine-instruction"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us now start from formulas, and build graphs from them. For simpler formulas, computers
      can draw graphs very well, but you may want to know how to draw one yourself. You do not have
      to learn to do it as quickly as a computer can, but the general idea will help you understand
      other concepts, such as topics from statistics or calculus.

      I would like to have a function that tells us the area of the square, Y, when we know the
      length of its side, X. How are X and Y connected?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The area is the length of the side squared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes, Y is X times itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> And who wants to tell me how it will look when written as a formula?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> "Y is X squared" translates into:
    </p>
    <p>
      Y=X
      <sup> 2 </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now we can transform the formula into the graph. We will use negative numbers too. Of course,
      a square with sides of negative length do not exist. But if we just consider the formula, we
      can use all real numbers. We can start by drawing just a few points, and see if there is a
      pattern on the plane. We pick any numbers we want for X, find the appropriate Y, and then go
      from 0, "walking" X units left or right, and then Y units up or down. So, let's look at some
      numbers!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We can write the X's we select, and Y's we get from the formula, right next to each other:
    </p>
    <p>
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            X
          </td>
          <td>
            Y
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            2
          </td>
          <td>
            4
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            -1
          </td>
          <td>
            1
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            3
          </td>
          <td>
            9
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            ...
          </td>
          <td>
            ...
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I will draw the pairs on the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">coordinate plane</a>. The first one is 2 and 4. We start from 0 and go 2 steps to the right, 4 up, and here we
      have the point. And so on with more points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We need to put enough points on the plane to see a pattern and guess what happens in-between
      the points we have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It takes a long time! Here are some points:

        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/FromGraphsToFunction-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now if we draw a graph dot by dot, we can use it to predict the values of Y by the values of
      X. It should work just as well as the formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see. Suppose I want to find Y for X=2.5. I go 2.5 units to the right, and then up to
      the graph... It is a little more than 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What value does the formula give you for Y?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <span class="mentor">Student:</span>
      </strong>
      <span>2.5</span>
      <sup> 2 </sup>= 6.25 That is what the graph shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are two ways of doing it faster. One way is to learn general laws that will help you
      draw functions using just a few critical points and by learning a little about how functions
      behave. Advanced algebra and calculus study these methods. Another way is to use a computer or
      a calculator to do the tedious job of finding coordinates, drawing points, and then connecting
      them. Let us make several more graphs of functions.
