      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Histograms and bar graphs look very similar. What's different about them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's take a look at an example of each. Here's a bar graph. What do you notice about it?

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the bars represent different categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Could we rearrange the bars if we wanted? For example, could we move "Debt Interest"
      to go after "Social Programs" but before "Social Security &amp; Medicare"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think so. It doesn't look like the order matters at all as long as the billions of dollars
      still matches every category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Let's take a look at a histogram now and tell me what you notice.
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/HistogramsVsBarGraph-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The bars don't really represent different categories anymore. Or if they do, they're not as
      clearly labeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right! They don't represent different categories. Can you tell what they do represent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It says "average SAT math score". I would think that the height of the bars represents the
      number of people who got that score. So then the different bars show how many students got
      each score, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Is that what the histogram says? Every student who gets a 500 is put into one bar, and every
      student who gets a 510 is put in another bar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, there aren't enough bars for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Then how do they decide which scores go into which bars?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It looks like they use ranges, but I'm not sure how they know what range to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's exactly right! Histograms use continuous data where the bins represent ranges of data
      rather than categories. Can you rearrange the bars in a histogram like you could in a bar
      graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, that would be too confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Now let's think about different sets of data and which would be better a histogram
      or a bar graph. For instance, let's suppose we want to compare total revenues of five
      different companies. Would you use a histogram or a bar graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would think you'd use a bar graph where each company is a different category and gets its
      own bar to show total revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! What about another example: We have measured revenues of several companies. We
      want to compare numbers of companies that make from 0 to 10,000; from 10,000 to 20,000; from
      20,000 to 30,000 and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Those are ranges of data so that sounds like a histogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Now what if we were looking at answers from a test question where students had four
      choices: 4, 5, 6, and 7. We want to compare how many students chose each answer. Histogram or
      bar graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, they're a series of numbers just like the SAT scores so I would choose a histogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Suppose that the answers to a test question were the following: rabbit, horse, dog, elephant.
      Which would you choose then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Bar graph because they're different categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. In the case of the answers 4, 5, 6, and 7, you would do the same thing. These
      are categories, even if the category labels are also numbers. They're not ranges like you need
      for a histogram.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think I get it now. Even if there are numbers, you have to ask whether or not they're
      ranges or categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! I think you're ready to start working with histograms and bar graphs now!
    </p>
