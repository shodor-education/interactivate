      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Today we will be working with right triangles. Before we start can you tell me what the
      definition of a triangle is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's a three sided figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, now knowing that can you tell me what a right triangle is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, a right angle is an angle that is 90 degrees, so wouldn't a right triangle be a
      triangle whose angles add up to 90 degrees?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You were right about it being related to a right angle, but instead of all the angles adding
      up to 90 degrees, it means one of the angles in the triangle equals 90 degrees. It would be
      impossible for all the angles to add up to 90 degrees because in all triangles the angles must
      add up to 180 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so a right triangle is a triangle that includes a right angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, now knowing what a right triangle is, what would be the sum of the other two angles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, if a triangle has 180 degrees total, and a right angle has 90 degrees, than the other
      two angles added together equal 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Perfect. Now we know the basics of a right triangle. What we will be learning today is how to
      find length of the third side in a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why can't you just measure the length?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, in some situations you can, but that process can be tedious and leaves room for human
      error. The mathematical process is much more accurate. Also, there are times when you cannot
      measure, such as when you don't have a ruler nearby, the triangle is not drawn to scale, or
      only numbers are given with no drawing to accompany it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so if you can't rely on measuring, how would you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> To find unknown sides in right triangles we use something called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">Pythagorean Theorem</a>. It is called this because it was created by a Greek philosopher and scientist named
      Pythagoras.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is the Pythagorean theorem and how do we use it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The Pythagorean theorem states that A
      <sup> 2 </sup> +B
      <sup> 2 </sup> =C
      <sup> 2 </sup> where A represents one leg of the triangle, B represents the other leg, and C represents the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">hypotenuse</a>, which is the side across from the right angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, but how do we use this theorem since there are three variables involved?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, remember at the beginning of the lesson I said that we would be finding the length of
      the third side of a triangle using the lengths of the other two sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I remember now! So we can replace two of those variables with the sides we already know! But
      how do we know which lengths the variables represent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, if I label the sides of my triangle with A, B, and C where A and B are the legs of the
      triangle and C is the hypotenuse, how would this information be helpful when using the
      Pythagorean theorem?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it would make sense that A would be the length of side A and B would be the length of
      side B.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, now lets find out why and how this theorem works and then we can practice using it a
      couple times. Lets go to the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/SquaringTheTriangle' | relative_url }}">Squaring the Triangle</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There's a triangle with a square attached to each side; is it a right triangle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image228.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Look over on the side where it says
      <strong>angle measurements</strong> and you tell me if it's a right triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It is! Angle C is 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, in this activity the triangle is always a right triangle. We're going to use this
      activity to test out the Pythagorean theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But wait a second, the angles are labeled A, B, and C, I thought that the Pythagorean theorem
      works with the lengths of sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right that the Pythagorean theorem works with the lengths of sides, but you need to
      remember that in different situations variables mean different things. It doesn't matter how
      the triangle is labeled, A, B, and C will always represent the sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So in this case it would be (line AC)
      <sup> 2 </sup> +(line BC)
      <sup> 2 </sup> = (line AB)
      <sup> 2 </sup> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so what are the squares attached to the triangle for? I thought the Pythagorean theorem
      only works for triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right that the Pythagorean theorem is only used for triangles, but if you look at the
      sides in the Pythagorean theorem you'll see that they are all squared. So, lets look at what
      really happens when you square a number. Get out a piece of graph paper and lets square 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But that's easy, its 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, but let's find out where the name squared came from in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so I've got a piece of graph paper what do I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> First take four boxes in a row on the graph paper and shade them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is it four because four is the number that we're trying to square?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, if we were trying to square nine then you would shade in nine boxes in a row. Now, you
      know that four squared is just four times four, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, its always the number times itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, and do you also remember that multiplication is really just adding numbers several
      times, so that 5*3 would in fact be 5+5+5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, and so 2*5 would be 2+2+2+2+2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Or more simply it could be 5+5, but you've got the idea right. So, 4*4 would be what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, that would be 4+4+4+4 wouldn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, so we have the first four already written on the graph paper, so lets add 4 more in the
      row right below the first four. So now we've added 4+4. Now lets add another 4 in the row
      right below the second four, and we've got 4+4+4. Can you guess what we will do next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Add another 4 in the row below that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, and with all those shaded in, what have you got?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's a square!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, that's where the term squared is from, because the result is in fact a square. To
      solidify this idea, try three squared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's a square too!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, so now can you guess why there are squares attached to the sides of the triangle in
      Squaring the Triangle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it's called squaring the triangle so they've squared each side of the triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image228.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But why would the activity be called Squaring the Triangle, think about the Pythagorean
      theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh right! In the Pythagorean theorem A, B, and C are all squared, and A, B, and C, represent
      the sides of the triangle, so they squared the sides of the triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! This activity was designed to help people understand the Pythagorean theorem so it
      has drawn a diagram of what the theorem actually means. Now using those squares how can you
      check if the Pythagorean theorem is true?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well...if A
      <sup> 2 </sup> +B
      <sup> 2 </sup> =C
      <sup> 2 </sup> shouldn't (the square attached to side A)+ (the square attached to side B)=(the square
      attached to side C)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, but which part of the square? The
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">perimeter</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Umm, I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, lets go back to the square you drew on graph paper. You said before we started that 4
      squared was 16 and you were right. So is the perimeter of the square you drew 16?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yea, it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Just to make sure it's right, try it with the square you drew for three squared. So what's
      the perimeter of that square.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's 12...but three squared is 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, this means that the fact that the perimeter of the first square being the same as the
      side squared was a fluke. The reason why it worked was because four squared is four times
      four, which is the area, and the length of the side is 4, and there's four sides so (the
      length of side*4), which is the perimeter. Now, that we know the perimeter is wrong what
      should we try next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How about the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">area</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, try it with your four by four square.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's 16! But lets check it with the three by three square to make sure it's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good Idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The area of the three by three square is nine! It works!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, so now we've discovered that a number squared equals the area of its square. So what can
      we expect for the Pythagorean theorem now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It would be (the area of the square attached to side A)+(the area of the square attached to
      side B)=(the area of the square attached to side C).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Perfect. So if you look on the left side of the pictures in the area labeled "area" you will
      see the area of the squares. What do you notice about them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Square AC+Square BC=Square AB.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image229.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Since the area is labeled "area" you can tell that the numbers in that area are all areas. So
      does the Pythagorean theorem work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Be careful, we have already discovered that using only one piece of data can lead you wrong.
      Try changing the lengths of sides AC and BC using the sliders below the diagram, does it still
      work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes! I can't find any arrangement where it doesn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, now that we know that the Pythagorean theorem works and why it works we can now start
      solving problems using it. Do you remember what I said we use it for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> To get the length of a side when you have the other two sides of a triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Almost right, this doesn't work for all types of triangles. What type of triangle does this
      work for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh right, it only works for right triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, so I'm going to give you the lengths of two sides and you tell me what the length of the
      third side is using the Pythagorean theorem. Getting a calculator would make this easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I've got a calculator; I'm ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, I'll start with giving you the two legs and you have to find the hypotenuse. OK, one leg
      is 5 and the other is 7. What's the hypotenuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so 5
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 25 and 7
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 49, so 25+49=74. The hypotenuse is 74!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Not quite, because remember that its A
      <sup> 2 </sup> +B
      <sup> 2 </sup> =C
      <sup> 2 </sup> . You did the first half right, A
      <sup> 2 </sup> +B
      <sup> 2 </sup> , but when you got 74 you forgot that 74 only equals C
      <sup> 2 </sup> , not C. So what would you do to finish solving this problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Square 74?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, think about it algebraically, 74=C
      <sup> 2 </sup> , so how would you solve to get C by itself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You take the square root of each side!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, so finish solving the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, the square root of 74 is 8.6, so C=8.6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great, lets try another one. How bout the legs are 3 and 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, 3
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 9 and 4
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 16 so 9+16=25. Then the square root of 25 is 5!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Nice work. Do you feel like you understand how to get the length of the hypotenuse when given
      the lengths of the two legs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes! What's next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now we will try to find the length of the second leg when given the lengths of the first leg
      and the hypotenuse. So to do that we're going to have to do a little algebra. You can try it
      first, and then I will help if you run into any problems. So how about 15 and 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Which one is the hypotenuse and which one is the leg?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, the hypotenuse is always the longest side in a right triangle. This is because the
      longest side will be across from the largest angle, the second longest side across from the
      second largest angle, and shortest side across from the smallest angle. We know a triangle
      only has 180 degrees and that the hypotenuse has to be the longest side, because the largest
      that an angle can be in a right triangle other than the right angle is 89.999. So since the
      right angle is 90 degrees, and the largest any other angle can possibly be is 89.999 than the
      side across from the right angle has to be the longest side, also known as the hypotenuse.
      Knowing that can you tell me whether 15 or 7 is the length of the hypotenuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It has to be 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, because 15 is obviously longer than 7, now can you solve for the other leg?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, that would be 7
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 49 and 15
      <sup> 2 </sup> is 225. So that would be 49+B
      <sup> 2 </sup> =225. Do I take the square root of 225?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, that would be if we already had the two legs, this is where we use the algebra. How would
      we get the B alone on one side?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well you would subtract 49 from 225 so that would be 176. So B equals 176?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, because remember the hypotenuse has to be the longest side, and the hypotenuse is 15, so
      176 is way too much. You need to finish the algebra to get B all the way alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh right, now I take the square root of 176.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, so what is the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's 13.266.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great Job. Now you know what a right triangle is, what the Pythagorean Theorem is, why the
      Pythagorean Theorem works, and how to solve problems using the Pythagorean Theorem. Do you
      have any questions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You've told me how to find the third side if I have the first leg and the second leg, and how
      to find the third side if I have the hypotenuse and the first leg, but how do I do it if I
      have the hypotenuse and the second leg?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It's the same as finding it when you have the hypotenuse and the first side. The variables A
      and B are interchangeable as long as you keep them constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I get it! The legs are the same thing so you don't have to have different strategies for
      solving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. Do you have any other questions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Nope!
    </p>
    <p />
