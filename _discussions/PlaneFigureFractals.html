    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So fractals like
      <a href="{{ '/activities/SierpinskiTriangle' | relative_url }}">Sierpinski's Triangle</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/SierpinskiCarpet' | relative_url }}">Sierpinski's Carpet</a> have
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/Recursion' | relative_url }}">recursion</a>, because they each have an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">initiator</a> and a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/g' | relative_url }}">generator</a>. Is this what it takes to be a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractal</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's part of it. Do you remember what else we've discussed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, there is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">self-similarity</a> too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Here's something else to think about:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the
          <a href="{{ '/activities/HilbertCurve' | relative_url }}">Hilbert Curve</a> an infinite curve filled a finite amount of space.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the
          <a href="{{ '/activities/KochSnowflake' | relative_url }}">Koch Snowflake</a> an infinite border contained finite space.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the
          <a href="{{ '/activities/SierpinskiTriangle' | relative_url }}">Sierpinski's Triangle</a> and
          <a href="{{ '/activities/SierpinskiCarpet' | relative_url }}">Sierpinski's Carpet</a> the area of the final figure was 0 - yet we could still see it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> These all seem to be contradictory statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This is why
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/InfinityAndIteration' | relative_url }}">infinity</a> was such a hard concept to understand for so long and there are still many debates about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I've seen lots of fractals now; what makes a fractal a fractal???
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's list the properties they all have in common:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All were built by starting with an "initiator" and "iterating" using a "generator." So we
          used recursion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some aspect of the limiting object was infinite (length, perimeter, surfacearea) -- Many
          of the objects got "crinklier."
        </li>
        <li>
          Some aspect of the limiting object stayed finite or 0 (area, volume, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          At any iteration, a piece of the object is a scaled down, otherwise identical copy of the
          previous iteration (self-similar).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> These are the characteristics that Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term) ascribed to
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">
        <em>Regular Fractals</em>
      </a> in 1975.
