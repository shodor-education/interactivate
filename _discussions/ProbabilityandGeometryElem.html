      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In the game we will study, players make a spinner, then agree on what each of them wins if
      his or her color is chosen. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Player 1</strong> wins 10 points when the spinner stops at yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Player 2</strong> wins 10 points when the spinner stops at blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Player 3</strong> wins 10 points when the spinner stops at red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the game fair? How can you tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, it's not fair. Player 1 will win more points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you know. It's just chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because the yellow part is bigger. The spinner is going to land there more often.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why do you think that is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The spinner can land anywhere in the circle, but half the circle is yellow. Half the time,
      the spinner is going to land in the yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right, the spinner has a 1 in 2 (or 1/2) chance that it will land in the yellow
      section. What fraction tells you how likely it is that the spinner will land in the blue or
      red?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If the yellow is 1/2, then the blue is 1/4 and so is the red. So they each have a 1/4 chance
      that the spinner will land in their section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! You're saying that whatever fraction of the spinner a certain color is, that's how
      likely it is that the spinner will land in it's section. It's easy to see in a spinner like
      that first one. But imagine a spinner like this:
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we measure each player's chances now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It would be nice if we could measure each player's "slice" exactly. How would you do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> People measure things by comparing them with standard units. You can say that a show is 25
      minutes long, a tree is 12 meters high, or a dog weighs 23 kilograms. We can use certain units
      to measure each player's "slice," or
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">sector</a>, of the spinner. Before we start, please tell me what is different and what is the same about
      these three spinners:
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It does not matter for the game which of the spinners is used. The chances of each color
      being chosen are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why do you think that is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The angles of each color are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Traditionally, people measure angles in special units called "
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">degrees</a>." These units were chosen in such a way that the following easy-to-measure angle is 90
      degrees:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-7.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      This angle is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">right angle</a>. A third of the right angle is 30 degrees, for example, and so on. There is a useful tool
      that can be used to measure angles. It is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">protractor</a> . It has units for degrees, much like a ruler has units for centimeters or inches. You can
      measure an angle by aligning the bottom of the protractor with one side of the angle, placing
      it so that the center of the protractor is at the vertex of the angle:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-8.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The whole circle's angle is 360 degrees, because there are four right angles in it:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ProbabilityandGeometryElem-discussion-9.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      It means that each player has as many chances as his angle has degrees, out of the total of
      360 chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What angle will give you a 1/3 probability of winning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A third of 360 degrees, or 120 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You can make some spinners for the game and find the exact chances of each player winning by
      measuring angles. Make the game fair by choosing how many points each player wins. Then play
      the game many times and see if the chances and actual winnings are close to what you
      predicted.
