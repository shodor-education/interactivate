      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Can you explain what
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">standard deviation</a> means? I'm doing a project in my biology class and we have to use it, and I don't understand
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sure. Let me think of an example that you would be familiar with...hey, your brother is a
      sharpshooter for the Marines, isn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Okay, what do you think a really good sharpshooter's target would look like? Would they get
      all the bullets to go into exactly the same hole?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, no sharpshooter is perfect--you can't hold a rifle perfectly still. It's going to move
      at least slightly. So their shots would be close together, but not in the same spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. There is going to be a little bit of what we call "random variation". One time it
      might be a little up and to the left, the next time just slightly right, and so on. You cannot
      predict the next variation, but if you look at all of the variations together you can get an
      idea of how skilled the shooter is with a rifle by seeing if the variation is large or small.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Ok, I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now, we can link this back to your original question. Standard deviation is the name
      for one way of looking at how tightly (or loosely) grouped a set of data is. It lets you
      describe the variation in a whole set of data with a single number. This can be useful in
      finding out how similar all the parts of a group are. For instance, if you were producing
      items in a factory you could tell whether or not the people, or machines, producing your
      product are performing well, i.e. creating products with little variation. If the standard
      deviation began to increase, it may indicate that a machine part is wearing out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, that sounds useful. Now, about my biology project?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, of course. Tell me what this project was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, I planted a bunch of beans, and grew one set under incandescent light and one set under
      fluorescent light. And after three weeks I measured the lengths of all the stalks, and I'm
      supposed to compute the mean length and the standard deviation of each group. I know how to
      get the mean, just add all the lengths and then divide by the number of stalks, but I didn't
      understand the formula for getting the standard deviation.

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It does look scary, but really it is just several easy steps squished into one expression.
      So, as with most complex mathematical expressions, the best way to tackle this one is from the
      inside out. Let's start with that funky zigzag-looking thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> My teacher told us that is was a Greek letter,
      <em>sigma</em>, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, it is. It is the Greek letter for "
      <strong>S</strong>", and we use it to mean "sum", or "add up". It is telling you to add up each of the d
      squareds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What are the d squareds?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> For each number in your data set, d is the difference between that number and the mean. And d
      squared is just d times itself. So you simply take each number, subtract it from the mean, and
      square your result, then add them all up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students: So that takes care of the sigma. Is the next step to divide by n-1?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, divide the sum of the d squareds by n-1, where n is the number of data points. Now,
      once you have completed that, what does the big bracket tell you to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Take the square root?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! That's all there is to it. So what's your result?
    </p>
