      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In order to see whether a line is a good fit or a bad fit for a set of data we can examine
      the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">residuals</a> of that line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why are the residuals related to determining if the line is a good fit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, the residuals express the difference between the data on the line and the actual data
      so the values of the residuals will show how well the residuals represent the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, well what do I look for when I'm examining the residuals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, if the line is a good fit for the data then the residual plot will be random. However,
      if the line is a bad fit for the data then the plot of the residuals will have a pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How would data that forms a pattern look compared to random data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's take a look at a set of data with a good fit and a set of data with a bad fit to
      see the difference. First, let's look at the residuals of a line that is a good fit for a data
      set. Using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Regression' | relative_url }}">Regression Activity, </a> graph the data points: {(1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 6) (7, 7) (8, 9)}. Now, select
      <em>Display line of best fit</em> and select
      <em>Show Residuals</em>. Now you can see the Residual Plot of all of the residuals found when the predicted values of
      the line of best fit are subtracted from the actual values.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The residuals appear randomly placed along the graph. I can see how this would be a random
      pattern of residuals. What would a residual plot look like for a line that was a bad fit for
      the data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's look at another graph. Using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Regression' | relative_url }}">Regression Activity, </a> plot the following points: {(4, -11), (3, -6), (2, -3), (1, -2), (0, -3), (-1, -6), (-2,
      -11)}. These points graph the quadratic equation -x^2 +2x-3. Now, select
      <em>Line of Best Fit</em> to plot a line to fit the data. Now select
      <em>Show Residuals</em> in order to view the residual plot that you want to examine.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hey, the residuals form a pattern! They are definitely not randomly scattered, but instead
      they are making a curve. This line was not a good fit. Will there be times when I won't be
      able to tell if the residuals form a pattern or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sometimes you will not have enough residuals to be able to see a definite pattern in the
      plot, but in most cases you will be able to look at the residual plot and, using this
      criteria, determine whether the line is a good fit or a bad fit for the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I noticed that the residual values (the values under
      <em>Line of best fit</em>) seem to have a sum of about 0. Does the sum of these residuals help determine whether a line
      is a good fit for the data or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The sum of the residuals does not necessarily determine anything. The
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/l' | relative_url }}">line of best fit</a> will often have a sum of about 0 because it is including all data points and therefore it
      will be a bit too far above some data points and a bit too far below some data points.
      Therefore, in the case of the line of best fit often the positive error will balance out the
      negative error so that the sum of the residuals will be approximately 0. However, this does
      not mean that the line is a good fit for the data; it only means that the line is equally
      above and below the actual data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, now I know that in order to find out if a line is a good fit for a set of data I can look
      at the residual plot and if the residuals are a pattern then the line is not a good fit.
    </p>
