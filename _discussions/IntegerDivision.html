      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now we should look at the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">division</a> operation. A good way to visualize what will be going on is to think of a piece of rope. If
      we have a piece of rope that is 12 units long, how many 4 unit pieces can we cut from it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If we cut 4 unit pieces of rope from a 12 unit long rope, we will end up with three pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct. To express this mathematically we would write 12 / 4, or 12 divided by 4. What do
      you think happens when we divide a number by 1 or 0? Be careful, though, 0 is tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If a piece of rope were r units long we cut off 1 unit pieces at a time, then we could get r
      pieces. So any number divided by 1 is that number. If you divided rope of length r into pieces
      that were each 0 units long. . . wait, can a piece of rope without length exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, that would be like having an object without mass, it cannot exist. For this reason we say
      that whenever a number is divided by 0, the result is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That seems to make sense. Getting back to the first example, though, what happens if there is
      leftover rope? Say, for instance, we wanted to take a 12 unit long rope and cut off 5 unit
      long pieces. We could cut off 2 pieces that are 5 units long, but we would be left with one
      piece that is 2 units long. What do we do with a situation like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> If you end up with an amount leftover that is smaller than the unit we are dividing by, then
      we call the leftover amount the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">remainder</a>. In the case you described we would say that 12 divided by 5 equals 2 with remainder 2.
