      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know what dimensions are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Points have dimension 0
        </li>
        <li>
          Lines have dimension 1
        </li>
        <li>
          Plane figures like squares have dimension 2
        </li>
        <li>
          Solid volumes like cubes have dimension 3
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! What can we learn from these statements? Let's start with a line, since points are not
      so interesting as far as
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractals</a> go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lines have length, but no width or height, so we can measure them in 1 dimension only. Because
      of this we say:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Euclidean dimension of a line is 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the line segment below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image85.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's build similar line segments at a smaller scale. We'll use a scale factor of 4 (the
      large segment is 4 times longer than the small ones).
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image86.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that we can get 4
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">"self similar"</a> line segments out of the original line segment at this scale factor. So: Dimension = 1, Scale
      = 4, and Number of self-similar objects = 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      You try this for a square (plane figure).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Ok: The Euclidean dimension of a square is 2 because we can measure the length and the
      height, but there's no thickness. Consider the square below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image87.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's build similar squares at a smaller scale. We'll use a scale factor of 3 (the side of
      the large square is 3 times longer than the small ones).
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image88.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that we can get 9 "self-similar" squares out of the original square at this scale
      factor. So: Dimension = 2, Scale = 3, and Number of self-similar objects = 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's do a cube (solid) together: The Euclidean dimension of a cube is 3 since we can measure
      the length, width and height. Consider the cube below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image89.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's build similar cubes at a smaller scale. We'll use a scale factor of 2 (the side of
      the large cube is 2 times longer than the small ones).
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image90.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that we can get 8 "self-similar" cubes out of the original cube at this scale factor.
      So: Dimension = 3, Scale = 2, and Number of self-similar objects = 8.
    </p>

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What pattern do you see here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Dimension, Scale and Number of copies seems to follow:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image91.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good!
      <strong>Fractals are objects that have fractional dimensions!</strong> To see this we need to learn about finding D when we know S and N -- this is not trivial
      since D is in the exponent. We need to talk about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ExponentsAndLogarith' | relative_url }}">Exponents and Logarithms</a> .
