      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What comes to your mind when I say that a person has a lot of
      <em>energy</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That person is very active, doing a lot of things quickly, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, and the scientific definition of energy isn't very different from that idea.
      Basically, energy is the capability to do work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But energetic people are not always doing work. Is the scientific definition of work
      different from the normal definition?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! In scientific terms, work is force exerted parallel to the direction of motion. Can
      you think of an example?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When you lift a box, you are exerting a force upward, the box is moving upward, and you are
      doing work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. Given that energy is the capacity to do work, do you know what types of energy exist?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, since energy has to do with moving objects, is there an energy of motion?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, this is called
      <em>kinetic</em> energy. Any object that is moving is said to have kinetic energy. Now, what happens to energy
      if you throw a ball up in the air?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see...As the ball rises into the air, the velocity of the ball decreases. Does that
      mean that the energy is decreasing? And then when it comes down and speeds up, is the energy
      increasing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The
      <em>kinetic</em> energy does decrease as the ball rises in the air and slows. Then, when the ball comes down
      and increases in speed, the
      <em>kinetic</em> energy increases. Do you know why I'm specifying
      <em>kinetic</em> energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are there other kinds of energy besides just kinetic energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's exactly right! According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, the amount of energy in
      a system must always remain constant. But we know that
      <em>kinetic</em> energy is decreasing and increasing when we throw a ball in the air. How do you think this
      happens?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Kinetic energy is definitely decreasing and increasing, so I guess there must be another type
      of energy that the object gets as it rises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Quite correct, this type of energy is called
      <em>potential</em> energy. Remember how I said that energy is merely the capability to do work? As objects move
      higher in the air, their potential energy increases because of the effect of gravity - a ball
      high up in the air can be dropped, allowing it to do work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That makes sense. I guess that if you throw a ball up in the air, potential energy must
      increase as kinetic energy decreases, and vice versa, so that total energy is always the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. The
      <em>potential</em> energy has to do with how high an object is and how gravity is pulling on it. But enough with
      <em>potential</em> and
      <em>kinetic</em> energy, are there any other types of energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know of any other ways to do work other than moving objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, if you can't think of any other type of energy, try using the Law of Conservation of
      Energy again. Why does a train stop if you put on the brakes? It's losing
      <em>kinetic</em> energy but not gaining
      <em>potential</em> energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I've always heard that trains stop due to friction, so friction must be a type of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're on the right track. Friction actually includes several different types of energy that
      you can perceive as a train stops:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Thermal</em> Energy, which is heat that can be created via friction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Sonic</em> Energy, which is the sound you hear as a train
          <em>screeches</em> to a halt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Light</em> Energy, which you might see in the form of sparks flying or the hot metal on the train
          glowing red.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So this means that when you are checking to make sure that total energy stays constant, you
      have to include all of these other forms of energy as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! However, there are still a few more types of energy to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Wait a minute, how do physicists actually find all of these types of energy? How can you tell
      if something is energy or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The easiest way to find other types of energy is to imagine a real-world example where it
      seems like energy is not conserved. The Law of Conservation of Energy is always correct, so
      there must be one or more other types of energy to make up for any shortfalls. For instance,
      what happens to the energies of someone as they jump on a trampoline?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> As they land, their speed and
      <em>kinetic</em> energy decrease, but they are going down so their
      <em>potential</em> energy also decreases. Trampolines do make sounds and give off a bit of heat when you jump on
      them, but it can't be enough to totally reverse your fall. Moreover, somehow when you land
      enough energy is stored to send you skyward once more. Hence, there must be some type of
      "spring energy" that trampolines gain as they stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, the "spring energy" to which you refer is called
      <em>mechanical</em> energy and describes the stored energy of springs, rubber bands, and, yes, trampolines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That seems pretty easy. Are there any other types of energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are three more forms of energy. Can you figure out any of them from your life and
      experiences?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, when I turn on a light something must be creating light energy, so is electricity a
      type of energy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Absolutely,
      <em>electromagnetic</em> energy - the energy of electromagnetically charged particles - is one of the most convenient
      forms of energy because it can be transferred over large distances and stored easily in the
      form of batteries. Basically, electromagnetic energy is the energy of attraction between
      positively and negatively charged particles. A flow of electrons circulating along a wire is
      like water rushing down a stream: the force of its motion can be used to do work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> And we see that kind of energy in all of the electronics we use, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! Although physicists are currently working on a so-called Grand Unified Theory that
      would combine
      <em>electromagnetic</em> and
      <em>gravitational</em> force, so your children may only have to learn one less type of energy and force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Wow, sometimes I forget that physics is still changing as new discoveries are made. You
      usually tend to think of mathematical studies as being fixed, but actually theories are
      changed all the time as new discoveries are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good point. In fact, one of the more modern forms of energy was first theorized in 1905 and
      was successfully used in the 1940s -
      <em>Nuclear</em> Energy. But there's still one known form of energy left. Consider the burning of wood. What
      are the energy inputs and outputs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see, to burn wood you must first set it on fire, which requires heat energy, but then
      the wood produces a lot more thermal and light energy than the spark that started the fire.
      Maybe wood loses mass as it burns, since there is always less ash left after the fire than
      there was wood beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's an interesting idea, but the only way matter can be converted into energy is through a
      nuclear process, and clearly a bonfire does not cause a nuclear explosion. All of the missing
      mass you mention leaves the fire in the form of smoke and water vapor. No, the energy of wood
      is something entirely different:
      <em>chemical</em> energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So chemical energy is the energy stored in anything inflammable?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Anything inflammable has
      <em>chemical</em> energy, certainly, though
      <em>chemical</em> energy can also be stored in nonflammable objects. In general,
      <em>chemical</em> energy is the energy stored in the bonds between atoms. When wood burns, those bonds are
      broken and their energy is released in the form of light and heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So chemical energy is substance-specific, like thermal energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, many of the types of energy are related to one another. The most important thing to
      remember, though, is the Law of Conservation of Energy. No matter what problem you are
      solving, the total energy of the system must always remain constant.
