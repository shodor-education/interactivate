      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tortoise' | relative_url }}">Tortoise and the Hare</a> ,
      <a href="{{ '/activities/CantorComb' | relative_url }}">Cantor's Comb</a>, and the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/HilbertCurve' | relative_url }}">Hilbert Curve</a> activities, we are asked to think about what happens if we repeat the same thing " infinitely
      many times." Sometimes we are told to repeat a pattern "
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">indefinitely</a>." What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This is an important idea from math, but it's not very precise when stated as "infinitely
      many times" or "indefinitely." Let's try to clarify this. First a new word: Repeating a set of
      rules or steps over and over is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">iteration</a>. Each step is an
      <em>iterate</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So when we ran the tortoise and hare race, each time we pressed the advance button we were
      iterating? And each time we pressed the next step button on the Hilbert curve we were
      iterating?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. Now, when did you stop on each of these?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the tortoise and hare race, I stopped when the computer wouldn't let me go any further, I
      think it was step 15. The tortoise was always ahead but wasn't at the finish line yet. In the
      Hilbert curve, I stopped when the computer froze, at the 7th stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Unfortunately for our purposes, a computer's memory is finite and will only let you repeat
      the experiment a limited number of times. Were you able to repeat the experiments enough times
      to picture what would happen if you continued to repeat the experiment many more times?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So if the computer would let you, you could have just kept pressing the buttons -- iterating
      -- forever, supposing you can live forever to do it. This is what we mean by "infinitely many
      times."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That still isn't very precise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right. Let's fix this too. We need another definition. Infinite means larger than any
      fixed counting number. Here's a large counting number:
    </p>
    <p>
      1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you find one bigger?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's easy! Just add one:
    </p>
    <p>
      1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,001
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! So anytime I give you a counting number, mathematicians call them Natural Numbers, you
      can find another number which is greater than the one I gave you. This is part of the idea of
      infinite. So when we say infinitely many times, we mean more than any counting number. There
      are other parts that are less easy to understand; in fact, it took thousands of years to get
      the idea of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">infinity</a> right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Greeks hated the idea that there could be a set of infinitely many things, like
      the set of Natural Numbers. Infinity was regarded as an impossible concept. People struggled
      with the idea for centuries. It wasn't until the dawn of the twentieth century with the work
      of Georg Cantor, who developed the Cantor Comb, that the idea was understood well. Here are
      some of the interesting things about infinity:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Things that work for finite sets may not work for infinite sets.
        </li>
        <li>
          An infinite amount of stuff doesn't always take an infinite amount of space. Think about
          the Hilbert curve: It was "infinitely" long, but fit in the square.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sum of an infinite number of numbers can be finite. Think about the tortoise and hare
          race: The tortoise travels the following distances, one fraction for each time step:
          <div class="h-center">
            1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + .......
          </div>
          but never gets to the end of the race! So the sum above never gets past 1!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mathematics of calculus deals with infinite sums and solves these types of problems. It is
      known as the mathematical concept called a "limit."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So I can think of infinity as being larger than any counting number? And iterating infinitely
      many times is the idea of repeating the steps forever?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> For now these are good ways to think. Here is a more standard way to say "repeat infinitely
      many times:"
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <p>
          <em>Let the number of iterations approach infinity.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can go home today and tell your parents you learned something about the fundamentals
      of calculus!
