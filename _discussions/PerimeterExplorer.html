      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is there a way to calculate perimeter without having to count everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, let's look at an example. The first step is think about how we find perimeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PerimeterExplorer-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the length is 4 and the width is 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now, lets find the perimeter of the shape. Perimeter is the distance around the shape, which
      is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PerimeterExplorer-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the perimeter is two times four plus two times five.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes it is. Now remember that me must multiply first and then add according to the order of
      operations. So the perimeter of the shape is eight plus ten, which equals eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Can we always multiply 2 times the length like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a good question. You tell me. Can you think of a time when that wouldn't work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If the shape looked like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PerimeterExplorer-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good thinking. But as long as we're dealing with rectangles, we can always use our algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/PerimeterExplorer-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What do we do if it is a funny looking shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You have a couple options. You can always use
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/PerimeterAlgorithm' | relative_url }}">this other algorithm</a>. But what do you think you could do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think you can probably just count all the way around the shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, and if you're careful, that will always get you the right answer. Now lets play with
      the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}">Perimeter Explorer </a> applet and see how well our method works.
