      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Any number can be made into a fraction, and many fractions can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How can a whole number, such as 4 or 5 or 20, be made into a fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> By putting the number 1 as the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">denominator</a> of any number, that number can be expressed as a fraction, but still keep its value. 5/1 = 5,
      and 20/1 = 20
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Could I also write a fraction that equals 5 if I expressed it as 20/4? Because 20/4 =5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, that also works, but notice that the fraction 20/4 can be reduced by dividing the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">numerator</a> and denominator by 4. Therefore, the simplest way to express the value 5 as a fraction is by
      writing 5/1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This is a helpful thing to remember when working with fractions and whole numbers, such as
      adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing them. Sometimes it helps to write the whole
      numbers as fractions when solving the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The fractions 20/4 and 5/1 are equal to each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. Which fraction would be greater, 3/4 or 4/5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I am not sure. Can I try drawing a picture to help me see the solution?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good idea. First we could start by drawing two bars of equal length, but breaking one bar
      into four equal sections, and the other into five equal sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I see, then we color in as many pieces as are in the numerator: 3 for the bar with four
      segments and 4 for the one with five. They now show what 3/4 and 4/5 looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, now I can easily see that the fraction 4/5 is greater than 3/4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. So which fraction is less, 1/6 or 1/8?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, let me start by drawing two bars of equal length, dividing them into as many pieces as
      are in the denominator, and .....
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you finish this student's work? Which fraction is less?
    </p>
