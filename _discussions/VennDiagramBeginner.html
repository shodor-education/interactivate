      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In our last discussion, we talked a lot about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/SetsBeginner' | relative_url }}">sets</a>. Can you explain what a set is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Yes, a set is a group of objects that have similarities such as color, size or shape. Each
      individual object is called an element.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor"> Mentor:</span> If I have two sets of shapes, is it possible for the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">sets</a> to have
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">elements</a> in common? Can an element be in both sets?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes, because sets can be classified by different things, an element can be in one set because
      of its color, and in another because of its size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! So, elements can be part of two sets at once. I'm going to draw a picture to represent
      that, and you can help me put some elements in the correct place.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I put the triangle in the place where these two circles overlap. Why do you think that I did
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, it's a triangle but it's also yellow, so it is a part of both sets and should go in
      both circles. The way you drew it, it's clear that the overlap area represents belonging in
      both circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So what should we call those circles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Each circle is a set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! Can anyone think of another shape that I could put in this diagram? What about a shape
      that is yellow, but that isn't a triangle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> You could put the small yellow circle in the yellow circle, but not in the triangle circle,
      because it's not a three sided figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! What we are making is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">Venn Diagram</a>. Sometimes we use Venn diagrams with two circles, like the one we have drawn here, and
      sometimes it may be best to use one with more than two circles! Let's try to create a Venn
      diagram with three circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> To create a Venn diagram with three circles you will you have to find three categories or
      descriptions that could work together to create sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The important thing to realize is that the categories have to have an intersection. What do
      you think this means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Does it mean that they have to have something in common?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sort of. It just means that it's possible for all categories to happen at once. For instance,
      the categories green, small, and striped can all describe the same object. But what if I said
      I had a big, small, blue object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I wouldn't believe you! It can't be both big and small.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Can you think of any examples of three categories that will work for a three circle
      Venn diagram?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> In a three circle Venn diagram we could use the categories circle, red, and big.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! What is a shape that would be in the area where all three circles overlap?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> The big red circle would fit in all three. While the big blue circle and big yellow circle
      would only fit in the intersection of big and circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The small red circle would go in the intersection for red and circle, while the small yellow
      and small blue circle would only go in the circle set. The big red triangle, square, and
      hexagon would go in the area for big red shapes. The other red shapes would go in the red set,
      and the other big shapes would go in the big set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You both are right, great job!
    </p>
