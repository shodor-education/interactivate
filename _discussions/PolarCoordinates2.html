      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In the discussion on plotting points on the polar coordinate plane, we talked about plotting
      points on the polar coordinate plane. Well, just as we can plot functions on the Cartesian
      plane, so we can plot functions on the polar coordinate plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What would a polar equation look like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In the Cartesian system, x is usually your independent variable and y is your dependent
      variable. In the polar coordinate system theta, or symbolically, &theta;, is usually your
      independent variable and r is your dependent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Isn't that kind of backwards though from the Cartesian system? I mean in polar coordinates
      the dependent variable is listed first and in the Cartesian the dependent is listed second in
      the ordered pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Nice observation. This is definitely something to look out for. Why don't we try plotting a
      very simple equation where the dependent variable, r, is constant. Let's try r=3. This would
      be a graph of a circle with a diameter of 3 units. Do you know why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, sure! This is because r represents the radius. And if r is 3, then it would make sense
      that for all values of the angle measure, it would have to form a circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> And what equation do you think would create a straight line?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If a constant value of r creates a circle, then I guess a constant value of theta would
      create a line. Would &theta;=&pi;/6 be a line?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, nice work. Now let's try an equation that actually has the independent variable,
      &theta;, in it, say r=sin(&theta;). What would you do to plot this equation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, for various angle measures I would need to find r, right? I could make a table, choose
      values of &theta; to evaluate and then input values of &theta; into the function to find my
      coordinate pairs. Then I could plot them on a polar graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are right. There are many different types of equations that create beautiful shapes. A
      function like r=2+(3*sin(&theta;)) is called a lima&ccedil;on. How would you plot it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, I could create a table of values for this one too. I could make a table and input
      values of &theta; into the function to find out the value of r. My table would look like this:
    </p>
    <table class="h-center">
      <tr>
        <th>
          &theta;
        </th>

          r=2+3*sin(&theta;)

      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then I could plot the points on polar graph. The plotted points would look like this:

      <img src="{{ 'img/PolGraphSinT.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But connecting them seems complicated! What if I missed some important values in my table?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is a very good observation. It is often why we like to use computers because they can
      calculate many more points much more quickly than we can. Try plotting this function using the
      Polar Coordinates activity and see what you get.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Wow! That is a cool graph!
    </p>

      <img src="{{ 'img/PolGraphinAct.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Nice work. Any equation of the form of the formula a &plusmn; b*sin(&theta;) or a &plusmn;
      b*cos(&theta;) will create a limacon. Try a few more. Even simple equations like
      sin(a*&theta;) or cos(a*&theta;) can be interesting. Play with the values of a and see what
      happens. There are many interesting graphs you can make by plotting trigonometric functions in
      the polar coordinate system!
