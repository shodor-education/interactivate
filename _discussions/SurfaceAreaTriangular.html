      <strong>Finding the Surface Area of a Triangular Prism Discussion:</strong>
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can anyone tell me what
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">surface area</a> means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Surface area is the number of square units that are needed to cover the surface of a three
      dimensional figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Surface area is just what you see of a three-dimensional object, not what is inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, how do you find the surface area of a three dimensional object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, there are a lot of three dimensional objects such as cones, rectangular prisms and
      triangular prisms. The formula for finding surface area cannot be the same for all of these
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is true! Three-dimensional figures have different formulas for surface area depending on
      their shape. Let's examine the surface area specifically of a triangular prism.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Since we are finding the surface area of this shape, how many sides will we need to include?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> This is a triangular prism so it has 5 sides (the two triangular sides and three rectangular
      sides). We have to make sure to count how many square units are on each of the five sides.
      That will give us the entire area that covers the shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! Lets first look at the top surface of this figure. How many square units cover this
      triangular surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/SurfaceAreaTriangular-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> You are asking me to find the area. I remember learning that the area of a triangle is 1/2
      times the base times the height.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> For this activity we are going to call the base of the trianglular prism the base width and
      we are going to call the height of the prism the base depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> OK, then the base width is 4 units and the base depth is 6 units. Therefore, the area would
      be:
    </p>
    <p>
      1/2 x 4 x 6 = 12 square units
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right. Now, are there any other surfaces on this triangular prism that would be
      identical to the one we just worked with?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The surface directly below this (the other triangular side of the prism) should have the same
      amount of cubic units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is true, but why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, the base width of the flat triangular shape will be the same (4 units) and the base
      depth of the shape will be the same (6 units) so that means that the area should be the same
      as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now we have two of the surfaces covered (each 12 square units). Let's move to the side
      of the shape facing towards the right. How many square units are on this surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/SurfaceAreaTriangular-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, one side looks like it is exactly 3 units, but I am not sure how many units are on the
      other side of the shape. It looks slanted and I am not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good observation. The side that is 3 units measures the prism height. The other length that
      you are confused about is called the slant height. It can be hard to find the slant height on
      triangular prisms. For this exercise I am going to go ahead and give you the slant height:
      6.32 units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> OK, if the slant height is 6.32 units and the prism height is 3 units then the area of that
      side would be 6.32 times 3, which equals 18.96 square units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. And is there another surface identical to this one on the triangular prism?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes, the surface opposite of this one would be identical since it, too, would have a prism
      height of 3 units and a slant height of 6.32 units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Excellent. Now we have four surfaces covered. Two of them are 12 square units each, and two
      of them are 18.96 square units each. Lets take a look at the last side that we can see of this
      three dimensional figure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/SurfaceAreaTriangular-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> This surface is easy! There are 4 units on one side and 3 units on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. The 4 units measure the base width and the 3 units measure the prism height. What will
      you do to find the area of this shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Since this is a rectangle all I have to do is multiply those two numbers. 4 (the base width)
      times 3 (the prism height) gives me the area of the flat rectangle: 12 square units!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes! And that means that we have found the area of five total sides. A triangular prism only
      has five sides so we have all of the areas that we need now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! So we have:
      <ul>
        <li>
          two surfaces that are 12 square units
        </li>
        <li>
          two surfaces that are 18.96 square units
        </li>
        <li>
          one surface that is 12 square units.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what is the total surface area of the triangular prism?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> To find the total surface area I would need to add all of the separate areas that I found
      together. It would be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          12+12+
        </li>
        <li>
          18.96+18.96+
        </li>
        <li>
          12 = 73.92 square units!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! You just found the surface area of a triangular prism!
    </p>
