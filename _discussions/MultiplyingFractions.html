      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I remember that a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fraction</a> is a number that is less than one!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right, but -1 is less than one. Is it a fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, so a fraction is between 0 and 1. And it has a numerator and a denominator, to tell you
      how many parts of the whole it represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's very good. Can anyone think of an example of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 4/7, where 1 has been divided into 7 parts, and you have 4 of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great example! Now does anyone remember what a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mixed number</a> is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think it is a number that has both a whole number and a fraction in it. Like one and five
      eighths, written 1 5/8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You know this well!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now do you recall how to multiply fractions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's like multiplying regular numbers only you have to multiply both numerators to get the
      numerator of the answer. Then you multiply both denominators to get the denominator of the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, let's try an example. What is 3/4 * 5/7?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 3 * 5 = 15, and 4 * 7 = 28. 15/28 can't be reduced, so that's our answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! Now who can tell me how to multiply mixed numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Its the same as multiplying with fractions, only you have to make the mixed number an
      improper fraction first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a great way to do it! Let's try an example: 2/3 * 1 3/4 = what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 1 3/4 = 7/4, so we just need to solve 2/3 * 7/4. 2 * 7 = 14, and 3 * 4 = 12. 14/12 can be
      reduced to 7/6. Then we can change it back to a mixed number to get the answer: 1 1/6!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Can you think of another way to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Could you multiply the integer by the number, then the fractional part and add the two
      answers together?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Again, another excellent method! Let's try it out. What is 2/3 * 1 3/4?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 1 * 2/3 = 2/3. 2/3 * 3/4 is... 2 * 3 = 6, and 3 * 4 = 12, so that's 6/12. 2/3 is the same as
      4/6, and 6/12 is the same as 3/6. 4/6 + 3/6 = 7/6, which is the same as 1 1/6. I know I did it
      right because I got the same answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. That's a good strategy to check your work. You can use either of these methods
      depending on which is simplest at the time.
