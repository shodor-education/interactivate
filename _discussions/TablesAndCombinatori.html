      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A player wins if one of his numbers comes up as the sum of two dice. Player 1 wins if the sum
      is 4, Player 2 wins if the sum is 5, and player 3 wins if the sum is 6. Is the game fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> It is fair, because each player has one winning number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Wait a minute! There are many ways for each sum to show on the dice. For example, the sum of
      4 can appear in three ways:

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> We have to count all the cases somehow.
    </p>
    <p>

        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TablesAndCombinatori-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, we do not want to miss any outcomes. Let us make a
      <strong>list</strong> of all of them. The first number we write will stand for the first die and the second number
      will represent the second die. It is faster to write only numbers without drawing the dice, of
      course. We will write all the pairs that start with 1 first, then all the pairs that start
      with 2, and so on.
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        1-1 1-2 1-3 1-4 1-5 1-6
      </p>
      <p>
        2-1 2-2 2-3 2-4 2-5 2-6
      </p>
      <p>
        3-1 3-2 3-3 3-4 3-5 3-6
      </p>
      <p>
        4-1 4-2 4-3 4-4 4-5 4-6
      </p>
      <p>
        5-1 5-2 5-3 5-4 5-5 5-6

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now we have all the outcomes listed. Does it help us to decide which player has better
      chances of winning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Not much. We have to go through the whole list looking for pairs that add up to the winning
      numbers. It was so boring to write all the numbers like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I just noticed that there are two errors in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Oops. I guess this way is not very reliable and not much fun. We can
      <strong>exploit the structure</strong> of the problem by transforming the list into more elegant, economical and clear form:
      <strong>a table</strong>.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Figuring out how to transform data lists into a table or tree should only be difficult on
      your first couple of tries. When you know how to do it, then you can proceed directly to the
      last step. We can put any additional information that we want into the empty table. Right now,
      we need the sums of the numbers on the dice to determine which player wins. Can you put the
      sums into the table?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> My pleasure:

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now it is easy to answer questions about the game. Is it fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Nope. Player 1 has 3 winning outcomes, Player 2 has 4 winning outcomes, and Player 3 has 5
      winning outcomes out of 36. Player 3 will win more often if they play for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How did you get 36?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, we have a table six by six, so there are 6*6=36 different outcomes for the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The science that studies the numbers of different combinations is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">combinatorics</a> (big surprise!) There are many beautiful, interesting problems in combinatorics. We will come
      across some of them in these probability units. How many different outcomes would there be if
      we had two coins instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let us see. Now there are two possibilities for the first coin, heads and tails, and two
      possibilities for the second coin. That makes 2*2=4 outcomes. We can put the outcomes in a
      table 2 by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What if we had a coin and a six-sided die? (12) If we had a ten-sided and an eight-sided
      dice? (80) If we had two spinners with numbers from 1 to N and from 1 to M? (N*M) You may have
      already noticed the rule: we multiply! This is a very famous rule:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you can choose two things, and there are M choices for the first and N choices for the
      second, you can have M*N different combinations.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you find some examples of this rule in work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Say, if you want to choose between a sports car, a van, and a truck, and they can be of four
      colors, then you'll have 12 possible combinations.

      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> A table can be used here, too. Even little children would understand it:
