      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When I was looking at the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/NormalDistribution' | relative_url }}">normal distribution</a> and the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/SkewDistribution' | relative_url }}">skewed distribution</a> activities, I noticed that the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">histograms</a> never looked much like the curves. When I made the bin size very big, the heights looked good
      but it looked like a row of large blocks. When I made the bin size small, the heights were
      very blocky because they only had a few values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So what do the curves really mean? Are they just guesses?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In a way it is as if you took an average of all the graphs you made, with all the different
      bin sizes. But there is a better mathematical way to look at it. Do you remember
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">experimental</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">theoretical probability</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. Theoretical probability is when you add up the favorable outcomes and divide them by the
      total outcomes. Experimental probability is when you try an experiment a lot of times, and
      divide the successes by the trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> And when you did something a lot of times, those two numbers got very close to each other,
      didn't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> And if you did it an infinite number of times, which is to say if you did it forever, you'd
      actually get back the theoretical probability. You'll learn more about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/InfinityAndIteration' | relative_url }}">infinity</a> when you study fractals, but for now what's important about it is that big numbers that are
      not infinite act more and more like infinity as they get closer to it. So we can believe that
      the theoretical probability of something is the same as if you ran the experiment an infinite
      number of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So if I flipped a coin, and kept track of the number of heads, forever, I'd really get half
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. And if you flipped two coins at a time, and kept track of how many heads you got each
      time, you might get a histogram like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ContinuousDist-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That looks like some of the histograms I had when I set the bin size very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. It wouldn't make sense to change the bin size on that graph, but what if we flipped more
      than two coins? Then there would be more possible values. If we flipped twenty coins each
      time, the theoretical graph looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ContinuousDist-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That looks more like the normal curve than a lot of my histograms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Remember this is infinite trials. But you are seeing something that is important. As you have
      more and more coins per flip, you have more and more possibilities. When you have infinite
      trials, you get back an exact theoretical height, and as you get out toward infinite
      possibilities, you get more and more points with intermediate heights. When you have infinite
      possibilities and infinite trials, you get a smooth curve. Now how do you think this might be
      different between statistics and probability?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, in statistics you can't always repeat the same experiment twice, much less infinite
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There's one more thing. In statistics you have as close to infinite possibilities as your
      measurement allows, partly because of what you just said. You might be measuring the heights
      of different plants, which could have an infinite number of random variables controlling how
      tall they grew. But the same idea still works. If you perform an infinite number of trials of
      an experiment with infinite possibilities, then the result will be a smooth theoretical curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> And that's what the normal curve is!
    </p>
