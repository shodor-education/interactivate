      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">remainders</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> To see what remainders are, we need to look at division of whole numbers. Suppose we have two
      numbers X and Y and we want to see how many times X goes into Y. We would use long division,
      and we would get the number of times X can be divided out of Y -- this is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/q' | relative_url }}">quotient</a> -- plus possibly some left over amount if X doesn't divide Y evenly -- this is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">remainder</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So let me try an example. Suppose I want to find out how many times 3 goes into 14. I know 3
      times 4 is 12 and 3 times 5 is 15, so I can get 4 threes out of 14 plus some left?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. 4 is the quotient and 2 is the leftover, also called the remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> This is related to
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mixed number</a> fractions, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is one way we can write the answer to this kind of division. The result of dividing 14
      by 3 is 4 with a remainder of 2, or 4 and 2/3 as a mixed number, or 4.666666667 as a 10-digit
      decimal number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How about a big one like 67 / 4? Let's see; using my calculator,
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/WhatAreRemainders-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      How do I get the remainder from this? I don't say 0.75, do I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, but you have all the information you need. The 16.75 lets you know that 4 goes into 67
      sixteen times, so now to find the remainder, just take.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        67 - 4 times 16
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      to get the left over. In this case the remainder is 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Couldn't I have figured that out from the 0.75? I mean 0.75 times 4 is 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! That's a good observation. I like the other method better, though, because it works
      exactly even if the calculator rounds. Try 67 / 7. On my calculator, I get:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/WhatAreRemainders-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the remainder here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I see what you mean. My way, I get
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        0.571428571 times 7 = 3.999999997,
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      which I could guess means that the answer is 4. Your way I get
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        67 - 9 times 7 = 4 exactly.
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Either way gets you the right remainder, you just have to remember to "fix" the calculator
      answer to be a whole number. This process of finding quotients and remainders is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">Euclidean Algorithm</a> after Euclid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we try
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ColoringRemainder' | relative_url }}">Coloring Remainders</a> , we need to talk a little more about remainders. Suppose I turn the question upside down:
      What numbers have remainder X when I divide by Y? Try this: What numbers have remainder 2 when
      I divide by 3?

      Neat! I see the pattern. Starting with 2, every third number has remainder 2 again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! Notice that this is true for each possible remainder: 0 (which is what we call "no
      remainder" situations), 1 and 2 all repeat. Here is a way to remember this -- mathematicians
      call this idea
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">modular arithmetic</a>. Put your possible remainders in a circle -- this would be all the numbers smaller than your
      given divisor -- and walk around the circle counting to find the remainder. Try it for a
      different number, say 5:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/WhatAreRemainders-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So to find the remainder when 22 is divided by 5, I start at 0 and count. I get to 2 when
      counting 22 moves around the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Does this match our other methods?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Seems to: 22/5 is 4.4 and 0.4 times 5 is 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This idea comes in very handy in advanced mathematics. It is so common that terminology was
      invented to ask this question concisely. When we want to find the remainder that occurs when
      22 is divided by 5, we ask:
      <em> What is 22 mod 5?</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try one more: What is 8 mod 5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I like the circle, so I'll do it that way. Counting moves around gets me to 3, so 8 mod 5 is
      3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good!
    </p>
