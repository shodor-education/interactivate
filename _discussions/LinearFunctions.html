      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So I have practiced guessing functions and am getting pretty good at it as long as there is
      one operation. The more complicated functions are harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, they are. The best way to understand such functions is to study one kind at a time.
      Let's start with functions of the form:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
          <strong>Y = ____ * X + ____</strong>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      These functions are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/l' | relative_url }}">linear functions</a>, and are often written as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
          <strong>Y = m * X + b</strong>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where m represents the number multiplied to X and b represents the number added to the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What's so important about these?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> These functions increase or decrease steadily. Look at the following function and table of
      points from the function:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        <strong>Y = 4 * X + 2</strong>
      </pre>
      <div class="preAlign">
        <table class="h-center">
          <tr>
            <td>
              X
            </td>
            <td>
              Y
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              0
            </td>
            <td>
              2
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              1
            </td>
            <td>
              6
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              2
            </td>
            <td>
              10
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              3
            </td>
            <td>
              14
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              4
            </td>
            <td>
              18
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, answer some questions for me. What is the value of the function when X is 0?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. What is the change in the value of the function as X increases by 1?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the value of the function goes from 2 to 6 to 10. So at each step the function
      increases by 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now look at your answers: 2 for the starting point, when X is 0 and 4 for the increase. Do
      those numbers look familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the original function, Y = 4 * X + 2, m = 4 and b = 2. The same numbers we got for the
      starting value and the increasing value. Is this a coincidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, it is not a coincidence. This always works. Try some.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Here are a few:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="preAlign">
        <table class="h-center">
          <tr>
            <td>
              Y = 10 * X - 1
            </td>
            <td>
              Change = 10, start = -1
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Y = -2 * X + 3
            </td>
            <td>
              Change = -2, start = 3
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Y = 5 * X + 11
            </td>
            <td>
              Change = 5, start = 11
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! But before we begin, let's get the terminology right: The change is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">slope</a> and the starting value is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">intercept</a>. We'll learn why these words are used later when we talk about graphs. Can you build a few
      tables of ordered pairs to further demonstrate these facts about your functions? You may wish
      to use
      <a href="{{ '/activities/SimplePlot' | relative_url }}">Simple Plot</a> to plot the ordered pairs from your table.
