      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What if I am solving a problem where some of the numbers are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">decimals</a> instead of fractions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You will need to know how to change a fraction into a decimal. That is a very useful thing to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What about this problem, where one candidate receives one-fourth of the votes in an election,
      and I need to know which of the amounts below equals one-fourth?

      <div class="h-center">

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, you already know that one-fourth is the same a 1/4, so the remaining problem is to find
      out how to change the fraction 1/4 into a decimal, such as answers b) and d) in your problem
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How are fractions changed into decimals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Remember from the
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ComparingFractions' | relative_url }}">Comparing Fractions Discussion</a> that fractions are really division. How would you turn 1/4 into a division problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So 1/4 is the same as 1 divided by 4. But the thing that confuses me is do I write
    </p>
    <p>
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="{{ 'img/image56.gif' | relative_url }}" />
          </td>
          <td>
            or
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="{{ 'img/image59.gif' | relative_url }}" />
          </td>
          <td>
            ?
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's review what the numbers mean. In a fraction, the denominator represents how many equal
      sized pieces a group or a whole is broken into; which in this problem is 4. The numerator then
      represents how many of those equal sized pieces there are, in this case 1. If you think about
      it this way, you can see the similarity between the idea of a fraction and concept of
      division.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's see how the fraction notation can be represented as division. The number on the
      outside of the division symbol represents how many equal sized pieces we are trying to divide
      the whole into, i.e the denominator. The number on the inside of the division symbol
      represents how many of these equal sized pieces there are, so that is the numerator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So that means that
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image56.gif' | relative_url }}" /> is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very Good! What next?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well since one is smaller than 4, I need to place a decimal after the 1 and add a zero and
      bring the decimal straight above the division symbol, like so:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image64.gif' | relative_url }}" /> but then I forget what to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well now it is just a matter of treating it like a long division problem and ignore the
      decimal. You can continue to add zeros after to the right of the decimal because 1 has the
      same value as 1.0 which has the same value as 1.00. Try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You mean like this?

    <p>
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            step1:

            <img src="{{ 'img/image67.gif' | relative_url }}" />
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            step2:
          </td>
          <td>
            <img src="{{ 'img/image68.gif' | relative_url }}" />
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            step3:

            step4:

            <img src="{{ 'img/image70.gif' | relative_url }}" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You've got it. So now that you know how to convert a fraction to a decimal, can you figure
      out the answer to our original question?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure. Now that I know 1/4 = 0.25, if I do the same process to 2/5 I get 2/5 = 0.4 Since the
      decimal values are different, the fractions are different too!
