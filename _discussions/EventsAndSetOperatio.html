      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We can look at a dice game to understand an
      <strong>event</strong> in probability. If a player wins when a six-sided die rolls a 1 or 2, we can say: "The
      <strong>event</strong> of the player winning happens in two outcomes out of six." Sometimes people draw pictures for
      events, circling or highlighting all the outcomes for each event.

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us consider one more game as an example. In this game, four players share a twelve-sided
      die. Player A (Anton) wins if the die shows 1, 4, 6, or 12. Player B (Boris) wins if the die
      shows 2, 3, 4, 7 or 12. Player C (Chris) wins if the die shows 1, 4, 8, 9, or 12. Player D
      (Dorothy) wins if none of the other players win. I will describe several events to demonstrate
      how convenient the diagrams can be. First try to find the probabilities without looking at the
      diagrams: this way you will see which of them are hard to find without the diagrams. Find the
      probabilities of the events listed in the table. The corresponding diagrams and the answers
      are also in the table. Instead of writing: "The probability of Event A is .33" we can write
      simply P(A)=.33 The answers follow from counting the outcomes, out of twelve total.
