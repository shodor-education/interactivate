      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We call a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">polygon</a> with three sides a triangle. Does anyone know what we call a polygon with four sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A square?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, a square is just one example. We call the whole family of four-sided polygons
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/q' | relative_url }}">quadrilaterals</a>. Can you think of other things that have four sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A diamond--like the kind that you draw or a baseball diamond. They have four sides. Does that
      mean that a baseball diamond is a quadrilateral?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! That certainly is a quadrilateral.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A door is a quadrilateral because it has four sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, any more?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A piece of paper is a quadrilateral!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A book!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A computer monitor!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A chess board or the chalk board!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> These are all wonderful answers. We should see how many quadrilaterals we see in our school
      and at home today.

      Now we can talk about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/Parallelograms' | relative_url }}">parallelograms</a>!
