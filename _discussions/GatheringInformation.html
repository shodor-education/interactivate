      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have seen people talking for hours about the same graph, as if they were reading a book.
      How is it possible for one little picture to have so much information in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do you know this saying: "A picture is worth a thousand words?" A mathematician would say
      that a graph is worth thousands of words. Of course, it is only possible because in
      mathematics there are many conventions about what each symbol or part of the graph means. This
      is not very different from the rest of life: for example, when you see a picture of a book or
      read the word "book," you do not need a long description of what it is and what it does. If
      you see bright cartoonish characters on the cover of a book, you may assume that it is a book
      for children, and so on. It may be easier to read symbols in math and sciences than in the
      rest of life. Do you know why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because there are exact agreements on what each symbol means. Let us try to read a graph for
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Would you like to draw a graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      Student draws:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/GatheringInformation-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Some parts of your graph are very easy to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Like the last part, when the distance was not changing at all. I can tell a little story
      about it. Let me choose units for time and distance, say, seconds and meters. So my story
      about the last part would be: "For about three seconds, everything was still. The person
      stayed two meters away from the origin."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> When "everything is still," in mathematical terms, the dependent variable (distance in your
      example) does not change when the independent variable (time in your example) changes. In
      math, things that do not change are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">constants</a>. Functions that stay the same no matter what the variable does are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">constant functions</a>. So the last part of your graph is an example of a constant function graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think all straight line parts should be easy to read. In the first part of the graph, the
      person moved from a point three meters from the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">origin</a> to the point four meters from the origin. It took two seconds. It took one second to cover
      the first half-meter, and one more second to cover the second half-meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> With this type of motion, called
      <strong>uniform</strong>, it always takes the same time to cover the same distance. In other words,
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">velocity</a> does not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We can say that for uniform motion velocity is constant. So, if I see a straight line graph
      of distance vs. time, I will know that the velocity was the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is possible to find velocity for uniform motion from the graph of distance vs. time. Try
      to do it with the parts of your graph that describe such motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> That would be the first part and the third part.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> And the last part. For the last part, velocity is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Right. For the first part, the velocity is 1/2 meter per second.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> And for the third part of the graph, it is about 4 meters per second.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I would put the minus sign in front of 4 for the third part, because the person we describe
      was moving backwards, and getting closer to the zero point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So for the third part of the graph, velocity is -4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Here are more examples of uniform motion. I used v for velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/GatheringInformation-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The second part of the original graph is not a straight line:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/GatheringInformation-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This means that velocity was changing during that time. The question is, was the person
      speeding up or slowing down?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> During the first second, the person covered about two meters, and during the next second,
      about a third of a meter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> If you look at half seconds, you see the same: a meter and a half during the first
      half-second, a half of a meter during the second half-second, and a third of a meter during
      the third half-second. The person was slowing down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you draw more graphs of distance vs. time when velocity decreases? Make sure to include a
      couple of graphs with negative velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Student 1 draws:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/GatheringInformation-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I do not understand why velocity decreases in your graphs. Take the green graph: it shows
      that the person covered about half a meter in the first second, about a meter in the second
      one, and about two meters in the third second. How is it "less and less"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> You are forgetting the sign! The person described by the green graph is moving faster, but
      velocity is negative (the person is going "back"), so it is really decreasing. You can say it
      becomes "more negative."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The graphs that describe functions with the rate of change (velocity) decreasing are called
      concave down. Do you see why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> They are curved down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I guess if a graph is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">concave up</a>, velocity will increase and the graph will look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/GatheringInformation-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> You are right. I will make the table for distance and velocity approximations for this one:
