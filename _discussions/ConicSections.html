    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Today, we're going to talk about conic sections. Do you know what the four conic sections are?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They're the Parabola, Hyperbola, Ellipse, and Circle, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. If you look at the graphs of each of these conic sections, you'll see that they
    look very different.

    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" /> What do you suppose makes them conic sections then?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Do they have something to do with cones?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Absolutely! All of the graphs can be formed by the same process. First of all, what is a
    <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">cross section</a>?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's when you slice a three-dimensional object with a plane, creating a two-dimensional
    object.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! So conic sections are just cross sections of a double cone. What do I mean by a
    "double cone"?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's two cones, right? Where the points of the cones are just barely touching.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Why might I need
    <strong>two</strong> cones to make conic sections? What about these cross sections requires two cones?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The hyperbola has two sides, so you need two cones to create it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! The way you cut the cones can create each of the different conic sections. Can
    you find the ways to create each one?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The circle is made by slicing the double cone exactly parallel to its base, like this:
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-5.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" class="h-center" /> And the parabola is made by slicing the double cone exactly parallel to the edge of the double
    cone, like this:
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-6.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's exactly right. Now let's think about the ellipse. It's sort of a mix between a parabola
    and a circle, right? So how do you slice the double cone?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The ellipse is any slice between a parabola and a circle, right? Like this:
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-7.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Now what about the hyperbola?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know, because a parabola that intersects both cones is a hyperbola. Shouldn't it just
    be the same as a parabola?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But you said that a parabola is something parallel to the edge of the cone. What do we know
    about the definition of parallelism?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When two lines are parallel, they never intersect. So if a parabola is created by a slice that
    is parallel to the edge of the cone, it can't be a hyperbola. Is a hyperbola created by slicing
    the double cone at any point between the two parabola planes?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Just like in this picture:
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-8.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, I get it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So that's the geometric definition of the different conic sections, but how would you be able
    to define each of these figures algebraically?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, for a circle I know that you just need the center and the radius to define it uniquely.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Precisely! As it turns out, you can find some version of the "center" and "radius" for all of
    the conic sections. For instance, the elipse is just a circle that has been stretched or
    compressed in one direction, so all you need to find the location of an ellipse is the center,
    the radius of the major axis, and the radius of the minor axis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So the major and minor axes are like the radius of the circle horizontally and vertically?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Usually, but remember that an ellipse could be stretched diagonally or some other direction
    that isn't exactly horizontal or vertical, like in this figure:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-9.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, that's right. That figure would have a major axis along the line
    <em>y</em> =
    <em>x</em> and a minor axis along the line
    <em>y</em> = -
    <em>x</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! Now, what information do you need to know about a parabola?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hmm, there is no real center to a parabola, but I think that if we knew the vertex and how
    steep the curve was, we could define the curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We do indeed need to know the vertex, but instead of finding how steep the curve is, we can use
    another special property of parabolas. What do you notice about the pairs of blue lines in this
    graph?
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-10.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In each pair of lines, the line from the focus to the curve looks about the same length as the
    line from the curve to the black line below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! In fact, that is the definition of a parabola: the set of all points equidistant from
    a focus and another line, which is called a
    <em>directrix</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That makes sense. A parabola is defined basically the same way as a circle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now, what can we do with a hyperbola? How can we define two back-to-back curves?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Perhaps we could find a center between the two curves, and then measure the distance between
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's certainly a part of it, but actually, for every hyperbola there is an associated circle
    or ellipse:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-11.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> All we really need to know is the center, major axis, and minor axis of the ellipse (or the
    center and radius of the circle) to be able to define a hyperbola.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But how can we find the axes of an ellipse that isn't drawn?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Similar to the way all points are equidistant from the focus of a parabola, for a hyperbola you
    can find the distance between a point on the parabola and each of its foci:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConicSections-discussion-12.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Whereas in a parabola the two distances are equal, tn the case of a Hyperbola, the
    <em>difference</em> between those two distances is always constant.
