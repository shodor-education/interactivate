      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How can you tell if you're seeing a pattern or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, do you think you can define a pattern?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Something that is the same over and over again; something that repeats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So a sequence of the same exact object repeated over and over again would be a pattern?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It doesn't have to be the exact same object; it could be a part of the object, or one feature
      of the object, like color, or shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Ok. Patterns with color and shape are pretty easy to recognize. You just have to find the
      similarities between objects that are repeated and find how often they are repeated. But what
      about patterns with numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question. Patterns with numbers often have an operation that is repeated rather than a
      feature of the object. Can you recognize the pattern here: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Starting with 2, 4 is added to every number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job. The operation of addition is repeated in this pattern with every number. See if you
      can find the pattern here: 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know, I can't think of an operation that would make this pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I'll give you a hint, there are two steps to this pattern- two different operations are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh! You multiply by 2 and then subtract 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! When we see a pattern like this using math, it is often called a sequence. The pattern
      or set of operations that are used is often called the rule. We can write the rule of this
      sequence like this: 2*n - 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What does the "n" mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The "n" stands for any number in the sequence. So this rule tells you that for any number
      already in the sequence, you multiply it by 2 and then subtract 1 from it to get the next
      number in the sequence. Then, you do the same thing to that number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, I see. So if I wrote this rule: n^2 + 4, that would mean you square a number and then add
      4 to it to get the next number in the sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! I think you understand how to form sequences and how they relate to patterns!
    </p>
