      <span class="mentor">Student:</span>I was doing an Internet search for information about soccer. I put the word
      <strong>soccer</strong> in a keyword search, and got about 160,000 results. That's too many!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What do you want to know about soccer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I want to find some information about college soccer teams. Oh, let me try
      <strong>soccer team</strong> as a phrase. I will use quotation marks to find only those Web pages where the two words
      appear next to each other. There are about 30,000 results for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us try again. This time, we will try to get the pages that contain both the word
      <strong>college</strong> and the phrase
      <strong>soccer team</strong> . Do you know how to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, it's not hard. I just have to put plus signs before each word or phrase. Oh, this is
      better. About 10,000 results.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This kind of refined search can help you a lot! How many results do you predict for the
      search for "college"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A lot! A million, maybe? Let me try. Wow! 1,563,571 links. I guess the numbers can be
      different with different search engines, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There is an interesting mathematical model for the searches you just did. Let us draw a
      picture with two ovals, one for
      <strong>college</strong> search results, another for
      <strong>soccer team</strong> results. If you'll excuse me, I won't draw all million and a half links for
      <strong>college</strong> and won't even try to keep the proportions between the two
      <strong>sets</strong> of links:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, I see. When we do a search using plus signs, we only get documents that contain both
      <strong>college</strong> and
      <strong>soccer team.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In mathematics, this operation is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">intersection of sets</a>. Do you see why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can see it on the picture! It is harder to express it in words, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's why mathematicians are so fond of pictures. By the way, there is a special picture, or
      sign, for this operation. The signs in scientific language are often used to write (and read)
      faster. Let us use
      <strong>C</strong> for
      <strong>college</strong>, and
      <strong>ST</strong> for
      <strong>soccer team</strong>. Then the documents you found on your last search would contain
      <strong>C</strong> and ST, or using the special sign,
    </p>
    <p>
      C
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" /> ST
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      stands for
      <strong>and</strong>. Easy enough. But let us return to our search. 10,000 links is still too much!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us force the search to be even more specific. Are you interested in college soccer teams
      from around the world, or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I only want to check on the teams from the USA. So, I am going to refine the search even
      more. This time, I am looking for the documents that contain
      <strong>all</strong> of the words:
      <strong>college</strong>,
      <strong>soccer team</strong>, and
      <strong>USA</strong>. I am using plus signs again:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-8.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you draw a picture for your search, as we did before? Such pictures are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">Venn diagrams</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure. I will only use the first letters for the links. This time, I will have three...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">Sets</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Right, sets. One set for each word or phrase I used. By the way, I got about 1300 documents
      this time, because the search engine only selected those of the 10,000 documents with
      <strong>college</strong> and
      <strong>soccer team</strong> in them that also contained
      <strong>USA</strong>. There are a lot of documents that have the word
      <strong>USA</strong>, and a lot that have the word
      <strong>college</strong>, and a lot that have the phrase
      <strong>soccer team</strong>, but a much smaller number of documents contain all three!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-9.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So here we have the
      <strong>intersection of three sets</strong>: the set of documents that have the phrase
      <strong>soccer team</strong>, the set of documents that contain the word
      <strong>USA</strong>, and the set of documents that contain the word
      <strong>college</strong>. We can write it using the symbol for
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">intersection</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      C
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" /> ST
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" /> USA
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> By the way, can you highlight on the diagram what happens if you search for
      <strong>college</strong>,
      <strong>soccer team</strong> and
      <strong>USA</strong> without using plus signs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-12.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I will see the documents that have at least one of these words. There should be a lot of
      documents that do! Here is the picture for that:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-13.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This operation is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/u' | relative_url }}">union of sets</a>. There is a special sign for that, of course:
    </p>
    <p>
      C U ST U USA
    </p>
    <p>
      means that we are talking about all the documents that contain the word
      <strong>college</strong> or the word
      <strong>USA</strong> or the phrase
      <strong>soccer team</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The last search option I would like to discuss is using the minus sign. Suppose you want to
      search for documents that contain
      <strong>soccer team</strong> but not
      <strong>college</strong>...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If I want that, I will use the plus sign in front of soccer team and minus sign in front of
      college:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-14.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you draw a Venn diagram for that, highlighting the parts we will find?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/InternetSearchAndSet-discussion-15.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Now tell me, what is the special sign mathematicians use for this one:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It reads: "The difference between sets." Here:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>ST \ C</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It reads: "The difference between the set of documents that have
      <strong>soccer team</strong> and the set of documents that have
      <strong>college</strong>."
    </p>
