      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is there a way to calculate the area of random shapes without having to count every block?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes there several ways. Let's look at an example of the box method first. The first step is
      to "box" the object in. Then count the length and width of "the box".
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Area-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the length is 4 and the width is 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, who can tell me the area of the "box"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Area-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The area of the box is four times five, which is twenty. But what does that have to do with
      the area of the shape inside?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question. How many squares are there in "the box" that are not a part of the object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are six squares in "the box" that are not a part of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The area of the object is the area of "the box" minus the squares that are not part of the
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The area of this object is twenty minus six, which equals fourteen. This method does reduce
      the amount of counting a little. But, what about the other method?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The other method is called the break down method. In this method, you break down the shape in
      to rectangles. Here is an example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Area-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Does it matter how you break it down into rectangles? What if I broke it down like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Area-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It does not matter how you break it down. The way you broke it down is fine. In fact I will
      use your picture as the example. Who can tell me the area of section one?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The length is one and the width is two so the area is two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now, who can tell me the area of section two?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The length is two and the width is three so the area is six.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Finally, can any one tell me the area of section three?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The length is three and the width is two so the area is six.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The area of the shape is the sum of it's sections. Two plus six plus six equals fourteen. Now
      lets practice on some larger shapes to see how much our new methods reduce the amount of
      counting.
