      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have played with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}">Chaos Game</a>, the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Fire' | relative_url }}">Simple Forest Fire</a>, and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ABetterFire' | relative_url }}">An Even Better Fire</a>. Are there other examples of chaos out there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">Chaos</a> has been found in all branches of science; in fact most scientists now think that chaos is
      the rule in nature -- not the exception! Mitchell Jay Feigenbaum was a mathematician and
      physicist who was a pioneer of the chaos theory. He discovered that systems show consistent
      patterns as they approach chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What do you mean when you say, "they show consistent patterns as they approach chaos?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, he discovered that if two numbers very close together in value were input into the same
      formula, the numbers become very different from one another after several repetitions of the
      formula. He found two constants, which became known as Feigenbaum numbers, to represent these
      patterns in chaos. Feigenbaum also used these new fractal methods in his work with
      computerized mapmaking. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986 and in 2005 he was
      awarded New York City Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology for his studies
      in chaos theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Who else had a large impact on the chaos theory?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A man named Edward Norton Lorenz studied weather patterns and population. He built a
      mathematical model to show the way that air moves around in the atmosphere and from this he
      coined the term
      <em>butterfly effect.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I've heard of that before! It means that small initial changes can result in much larger
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right! The term butterfly effect came from the idea that the motion caused by a
      butterfly's wings can cause small changes in the atmosphere, which eventually could result in
      the impact of a tornado such as where it occurs or how strong it is. Big changes can occur as
      a result of one small event. There is also a movie about this phenomenon, titled
      <em>The Butterfly Effect,</em> which was released in 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yeah, I think I've heard about that movie. I think that I've seen the idea of the butterfly
      effect in several television shows, too. Sometimes, someone will do something and then you
      will see what happens as a result of that action and what would have happened if they had not
      done the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, exactly! It all relates to large effects because of a minor change in some system.
      Another person that dealt with chaos theory was Aristid Lindenmayer. He modeled plant growth
      and development in order to create realistic plant images and animate their growth processes.
      In 1968 he introduced "L-systems."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What are "L-systems?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> "L-systems" (short for Lindenmayer Systems) are sets of rules and symbols that model growth
      processes. Lindenmayer used them to model plant growth. He also published a book,
      <em>The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants,</em> in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Who are some other people that studied chaos theory?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Biologist Robert May studied animal populations and, more specifically, predator-prey
      systems. He examined natural communities through mathematics. May published
      <em>Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems </em> in 1973. You can learn more about his ideas related to population dynamics through the applet
      <a href="{{ '/activities/RabbitsAndWolves' | relative_url }}">Rabbits and Wolves</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Gosh, chaos is everywhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, and that's not all. Hans Meinhardt studied patterns and pigmentation on seashells. He
      wrote
      <em>The Algorithmic Beauty of Sea Shells</em> in 2003. Also, James D. Murray studied the patterns of fur markings on mammals. He published
      <em>Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Biological Pattern Formation </em> in 1993. The work that these men did is closely related to chaos theory and fractals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Wow, all of these people have created models to explain different patterns in nature. I had
      no idea that there were so many different patterns that could be explained mathematically.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> For even more experience with the idea you should try the
