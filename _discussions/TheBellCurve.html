      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But how can we prove the book wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Remember, we're not proving the book wrong, we're proving the conclusions people drew from it
      wrong. The book is too complicated for me to explain quickly what scientists found was wrong
      with it. That's why it took so long for the other evidence to surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But how can I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're persistent. Well, I can show you. The book claimed that each group of people had a
      normal curve of their own -- that some of them were very low and some were very high and many
      were in the middle. Then it went on to say that the middles were different.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So there will always be a few people out in the tails that will be different?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> More than that, but that is the right idea. Let's make two transparencies of the normal
      distribution, one purple and one green. Now let's say that Purples are smarter than Greens.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know anybody who is purple, or green, so I suppose they could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The big difference the book mentioned was about fifteen points on an IQ test score, one
      standard deviation. So let's put the mean of the purple distribution on the right,
      one-standard-deviation line of the green distribution, like this.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They overlap a lot. Everywhere the grid is blue, they overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Actually, they overlap all the way out. But the probability of a green being out in the
      purple section, or a purple in the green section, is one in a thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That is a very small probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Of course, the probability of a purple in the purple section, or a green in the green
      section, is less than two in a hundred. That's bigger, but it's still small when you think
      about how randomly assorted people are. Remember when you made a histogram fit under each
      curve? It didn't fit very exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So there could be several people in that section, or there could be none.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But what's more important is that there is a big overlap section in the middle. That means it
      is very common for both Purples and Greens to be in that whole area. Now, imagine making a
      histogram for each graph, only with one trial. Do you think it's worth assuming that the
      purple trial would be higher than the green?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It depends on what the outcomes are. If I were playing a dice game with my friends, I would
      like those odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But if you were betting a job, or a friendship, or the future of your new business...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then it would not be very good odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I would like to be much more certain before I judged a person. That's why I said I couldn't
      say anything about you or me based on what the book said, even if I decided I thought the book
      was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would not like to judge one person either. But there is still a big difference between the
      Purples and the Greens as groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That bothered many people. But then some of the scientists said the difference between the
      means was too big, and started talking about a difference of eight or nine points -- about 3/5
      of a standard deviation. That looks like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image208.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That has a much bigger overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Then finally some of them said that the difference was only three points, about 1/5 of a
      standard deviation. Now even if that were true, what can you say about this graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image209.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's hardly any different at all! It doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It doesn't seem like it's worth starting a controversy over now, does it?
    </p>
