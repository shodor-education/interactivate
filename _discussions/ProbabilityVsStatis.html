      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I notice that people sometimes use the words statistics and probability when talking about
      the same things. Are these two words just different names for the same concept?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What do you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I want to check a dictionary first and see what it says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Check several dictionaries and based on what you find, make a definition for each word. A
      scientific or mathematical dictionary will give you more detailed information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Probability</strong> 1: being probable
    </p>
    <p>
      2: something that is probable
    </p>
    <p>
      3:a ratio expressing the chances that a certain event will occur
    </p>
    <p>
      4:a branch of mathematics studying chances of random events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Statistics</strong> 1: facts or data assembled and classified so as to present significant information
    </p>
    <p>
      2: collection, calculation, description, manipulation, and interpretation of the mathematical
      attributes of large sets or populations
    </p>
    <p>
      3: a branch of mathematics dealing with collection, analysis and interpretation of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So statistics is all about data, and probability is all about chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Let me talk about probability as the measure of chance. Specialists look at this
      meaning of probability in two different ways that are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">Frequency View</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">Personal View</a> (or Subjective View, as philosophers call it).

        <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>Frequency View </strong>

            vs.
          </td>
          <td>
            <strong>Personal View </strong>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>Example: </strong>To find the chances (probability) of getting 3 on a six-sided die, you roll the die
            1,000,000 times. For 166,549 times, the roll is a 3. You find the proportion of 3's by
            dividing:
            <br />
            <br />
            166,549 / 1,000,000 = 0.166549
            <br />
            <br />
            It is approximately 1/6, so you conclude that the probability of getting 3 on this
            particular die is 1/6.

            vs.
          </td>
          <td>
            <strong>Example:</strong>To find the chances (probability) of getting 3 on a six-sided die, you sit down and
            think. You reason that all the sides of the die are the same, and that you can believe
            that the die does not have holes or heavy objects inserted into it. You conclude that
            each side of the die should have the same chance of landing face up, and therefore, that
            when you roll the die, you have one chance in six to get a 3. Your answer is that the
            probability of getting 3 is 1/6.

            <strong>Definition: </strong>Probability of an event in an experiment is the proportion (or frequency) of that event

            <strong>same exact</strong> experiment is repeated many times.

            <strong>Definition:</strong> Probability of an event is what a person who studies it
            <strong>believes </strong>about the chances of the event. People who define probabilities use their knowledge
            about the world to make "the best possible guess."

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Which of these two ways of looking at probability is closer to statistics?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The Frequency View, because it talks about collecting data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A very important part of the Frequency View definition is that you need to repeat the same
      exact experiment to find the probability. It is almost never possible where humans are
      concerned, for example, in sports or medicine. I would like to offer you several quotes, and
      you can find and correct the errors in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sounds like fun. When I learn to do it, I can find quotes in journals or on TV and correct
      them, too!

            all affect breast cancer rates in women. Even though "one out of eight" is the average

      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> All these errors are of the same type. They take data about large numbers of people, and try
      to use it in personal cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Collecting data about large numbers of people (or other objects), and using this data for
      studying other large groups of people as you did in the "Conclusion that may be true" column,
      belongs to statistics. The only time it can be used for probability, that is, for studying
      chances in individual cases, is when all the experiments are the same (or almost the same).
      You can use data (statistics) from rolling a six-sided die one million times (in exactly the
      same manner!) to find the chances (probability) of rolling 5 on your next try. You can not use
      data (statistics) from studying driving records of a million people to find the chances
      (probability) of yourself having an accident today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So statistics deals with data that may or may not be useful for finding probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. Data can also be useful by itself, without any connection to probability. For example,
      you need to know, at least approximately, how many voters live in a particular city in order
      to prepare for elections. You may want to know the average amount of hazardous chemicals each
      factory discharges into a particular water basin per month in order to find out if there is a
      serious environmental problem. You might want to know the proportion of people who get the flu
      during each year in order to compare several years and to try to find out what may cause
      increases in flu rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I am just glad there are computers to help us to deal with all that data!
