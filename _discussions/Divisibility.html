      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us make
      <a href="{{ '/activities/DiceTable' | relative_url }}">the game with two dice</a> fair. Can you assign every possible sum to one of our three players in such a way that the
      game is fair? Each will get several winning numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We have found several ways of making the game fair for three people. For example, Player 1
      can get the sums of 2, 3, 4, and 7, Player 2 the sums of 8, 9, 11 and 12, and Player 3 all the
      rest: 5, 6, and 10. The important thing is, each player has to get exactly 12 outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have made it fair for four people. Each gets 9 outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you make it fair for two people assigning all the numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure, each one will get 18 outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What other numbers of people can play the game fairly if someone wins in every outcome?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The numbers that
      <strong>divide 36</strong>. Three can do it. Five can't, because you can't divide 36 outcomes between five people
      fairly. Six people can have a fair game, but not seven or eight. It looks like nine people can
      play it if each of them gets four outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, we got into some pure abstractions here. Can you please set up the winning numbers for
      nine people to make the game fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Student (trying to do it):</strong> Not really, because whoever gets 7 as a winning number has six outcomes already! Actually, no
      more than six people can play the game fairly if all of the possible sums are to be someone's
      winning numbers.
