      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When I add fractions that have the same
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">denominator</a>, such as 1/5 + 2/5, I know that the answer is 3/5. But what do I do when the denominators are
      different?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The first thing is to find the lowest common denominator, the smallest number that both
      denominators divide into evenly. If I am adding 3/4 + 1/6, what is the lowest common
      denominator?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it looks to me like it would be 12. Both 4 and 6 can divide into 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! So you rewrite the problem to look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of 3/4 + 1/6, write it as:
    </p>
    <p>
      something/12 + something/12. Then you will see what the correct answer is.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out the "somethings", start with the first fraction. If you are changing the
      denominator in the fraction 3/4 to "something"/12, you multiplied 4 by 3 to get 12. So
      multiply the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">numerator</a> by 3 also. That gives us 9/12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, now I'll try the second fraction, 1/6. If I change the denominator to 12, I multiplied 6
      by 2 to get 12. So I will multiply the numerator (1) by 2, which is 2. So that gives me a
      fraction of 2/12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right so far. We just made the problem easier to solve by converting it this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      3/4 + 1/6 became 9/12 + 2/12
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's much easier to solve. 9 + 2 = 11, so the answer would be 11/12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! It works the same way for subtraction. Try this problem: 4/5 - 4/15.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see. The lowest common denominator is 15, because both 5 and 15 divide evenly into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I can rewrite the problem:
    </p>
    <p>
      4/5 - 4/15
    </p>
    <p>
      as
    </p>
    <p>
      something/15 - something/15
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with the first fraction. I multiplied the denominator 5 by 3 to get 15, so I will
      also multiply the numerator, 4, by 3. That will make the fraction 12/15.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second fraction is very easy. The denominator is already 15 (15 divides into 15 one time),
      so I will multiply the numerator by one, giving me a fraction of 4/15. My subtraction problem
      now looks like:
    </p>
    <p>
      12/15 - 4/15
    </p>
    <p>
      And the answer is 8/15.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! You learn fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you solve this problem 2/3 - 4/9?
