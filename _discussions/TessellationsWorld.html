      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We learned that a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">tessellation</a> is a repeating
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">polygonal</a> shape with no gaps or overlapping sections. Who first discovered these patterns, and who uses
      them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, first of all, think of different shapes that occur in nature, and see if you can think
      of some that can be classified as tessellations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can think of the scales on a fish, or a tortoise shell, or a pineapple.

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! So just by observing the world around us we can learn to recognize
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">patterns</a> and to use them in our work. Can you think of examples where people use tessellations in
      their work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A brick-layer creates tessellations while building walls!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> A quilt-maker sews blocks of fabric into tessellating patterns in a quilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. For thousands of years people have used tessellations to design beautiful buildings,
      mosaics, woodwork, weavings, quilts, floors, and gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Greeks and Romans created intricate mosaics using small pieces of stone embedded in
      walls and floors. These mosaics are not tessellations in a mathematical sense unless the
      shapes of the stones in them form a repeating pattern. But often, these mosaics use geometric
      designs that will tessellate across a plane in their borders or backgrounds. Larger tilings
      made of marble or granite are used in floors patterns. Sometimes entire floors are laid out in
      giant plane tessellations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Islamic art is noted for having extremely ornate mosaics. The more intricate designs have
      overlapping segments and therefore are not true mathematical tessellations. The highlight of
      tile-making and designing came in the mid sixteenth century during the reign of the Turkish
      sultan Suleyman the Magnificent. Many ancient mosques and palaces still stand in Istanbul, and
      their bright colored tiles have not faded. The Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia are two famous
      sites in Istanbul, Turkey, which use many tessellating patterns in their design. Sometimes the
      designs painted on the tiles form their own geometric shapes that when viewed from a distance
      appear as a tessellating pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      What other regions in the world use tessellating design patterns in walls and floors?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> China, where the famous blue and white porcelain ceramics inspired artisans in other
      countries to paint similar looking tiles; Japan, which is noted for wooden screens carved in
      tessellating designs; Northern Africa; and Spain, especially in Moorish architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Also the Netherlands with the famous Delft tile industry and England. The floor of
      Westminster Abbey in London has a fabulous design that many other abbeys imitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! Other cultures noted for using tessellations in their building and textile design
      include the Navajos and the Amish. What others can you think of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We can find art and architecture books in the library and find some more. But why are we
      studying them today?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are lots of reasons to learn about tessellations!
      <ul>
        <li>
          For recognizing their beauty, which comes from the different
          <a href="{{ '/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati' | relative_url }}">types of symmetry</a> they use
        </li>
        <li>
          For learning to measure angles
        </li>
        <li>
          For developing our powers of observation with
          <a href="{{ '/discussions/OpticalIllusions' | relative_url }}">lines and shapes</a> and
          <a href="{{ '/discussions/ColorTessellations' | relative_url }}">color</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
