      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tessellate' | relative_url }}">Tessellation</a> activity, the same shape is repeated over and over to make the pattern. Isn't this a type of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">tessellation</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. There are many symmetries in tessellations. However, you need to be careful that you
      don't confuse
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">symmetry</a> with the type of symmetries that we find in the plane of a tessellation. Can you tell me what
      you mean by symmetric?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span>: I think a figure is symmetric when a line can divide the figure into two congruent halves. A
      butterfly is an example. If I draw a line down the center of the butteryfly's body, each half
      of the butterfly looks the same, like a mirror reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. What you are describing is called line symmetry, though line symmetry is only
      one of several types of symmetry. A more precise definition of line symmetry is that if you
      draw the line of symmetry, each point on one side of the line has a corresponding point on the
      opposite side of the line. If you connect these two points, that line is perpendicular to the
      line of symmetry.

      When we are talking about an infinite plane, we refer to the symmetries we find as plane
      symmetries or geometric transformations.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about this tessellation though? Do you think it has symmetry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, I guess by my earlier definition, no because there is nowhere I could draw a line and
      have the pattern reflect on itself. But you mentioned something about there being other types
      of symmetries than just line symmetry so now I'm thinking that the answer is actually yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Your intuition is correct. There are three other types of symmetry in a plane. They all move
      a pattern in a way that the pattern still matches the original pattern exactly. What other
      movement can we make to this pattern so that the pattern's appearance doesn't change?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We could slide the whole pattern sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! This kind of symmetry is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">translation</a>. All translations have a direction and a distance. Can you make a tessellation that does not
      have translational symmetry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Part of the definition of a tessellation is that it is a repeating pattern. So, I think all
      tessellations have translational symmetry!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good observation. In what other way can you transform the pattern?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I could spin the pattern around a point, rotating it. That would leave the pattern unchanged.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">rotational</a> symmetry. Rotations always have a center and an angle of rotation. Can you find one more way
      to transform the tessellation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The only other thing I could do to the pattern would be to reflect it across a mirror line
      and then translate the pattern. But does that count? I am combining two types of symmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Actually, that is indeed the last type of symmetry and it is called glide reflection. This is
      the only type of symmetry that involves two steps: a reflection with a translation along the
      mirror line. Glide reflections are a separate type of transformation because some
      tessellations have glide reflections but not reflections or translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, see if you can make tessellations with different combinations of transformations.
