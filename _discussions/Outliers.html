      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">outlier</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> An outlier is defined as a value far from most others in a set of data. For example, given
      the following points: {(1,0) (2,2) (3,3) (4,5) (5,5) (7,6) (7,7) (8,1)}, which point do you
      think is the outlier? It might be clearer if we graph them:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Outliers-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well all of those points would almost form a straight, diagonal line except for (8,1) which
      seems far from most other points like the definition of an outlier says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! An outlier can cause problems if you're trying to draw conclusions from your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What kind of conclusions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> With graphs that use coordinates like this one, we often try to see if there is a
      relationship between the x and y values which can be shown by the line of best fit. So, if we
      graphed the line of best fit for these points it would look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Outliers-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would have thought the line would touch more of the points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. It looks like this because of the outlier. The outlier is causing the slope of the
      line of best fit to be less steep than you might expect. If we take out the outlier, (8,1),
      here is what the graph would look like:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Outliers-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can see that the outlier was affecting the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Another conclusion that can be drawn from data is the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mean</a>, which is also affected by outliers. Lets look at an example. We will look at the heights of
      a group that includes five 2nd grade students and their teacher. Their heights in inches are:
      48" 46" 48" 50" 44" and 72".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The teacher's height is an outlier. It isn't even close to the other heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Can you graph that on a number line?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Outliers-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now you can see how far the outlier is from the rest of the data. As I said earlier,
      outliers can affect the mean. What is the mean of this data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, to find the mean, I add all of the heights together (which equals 308) and divide by
      the number of people (there are 6 people) so the mean is about 51".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do you think 51" represents their heights well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, the tallest student is only 50" so 51" doesn't represent the heights of the students
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right. The 72" is influencing the mean. Lets calculate the mean without the teacher's
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Alright, I add the heights together, which equal 236, and divide by the number of people,
      which is 5, so the mean is about 47". That represents the heights of the entire group better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, 47" is a more clear portrayal of the data. So now you know if you have an outlier you
      probably need to examine your data closely to understand if you should choose to keep it in
      your data analysis or not.
