      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">Bell Curve</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The bell curve is another name for the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">normal distribution</a>. The normal distribution is a common type of graph that has more or less the shape of a bell.
      "The Bell Curve" was also the title of a highly controversial book published back in 1994.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What could be controversial about a graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, the book wasn't really about the graph it was about intelligence. If you graph scores
      on an IQ test on the horizontal axis, and number of people who got that score on the vertical
      axis, then you get the bell curve shape. The authors were talking about the way intelligence
      was distributed among people, so...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So they used the shape as the title of the book. But why is that controversial?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The book was controversial because it suggested that whole races were more or less
      intelligent than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's racist! How can someone say if I'm smart or not because of the color of my skin?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> They can't. A lot of people thought that at the time though. About a year later, a number of
      scientists published evidence that the book was wrong. But you know what? Even if the book
      were right, it is still impossible to guess how smart you as an individual are, or compare
      your intelligence to another individual, based on your skin color. We can demonstrate this
      with mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How? Show me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, first you'll need to know some things about the normal distribution and statistics in
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I remember
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mean</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">median</a> from the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Measures' | relative_url }}">Measures activity</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. That will help. Do you remember
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mode</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. Mode is the most common value.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There is one more number that you need to know for this, but it is one you don't see as much.
      The
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">standard deviation</a> tells you how spread out numbers are from the average.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You say average. Which kind of average are you talking about? Mean, median, or mode?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a good question. It is from the mean, but it happens that in the normal distribution,
      the mean, median, and mode are all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That isn't very useful. Is it? I saw a lot of distributions where they were very different
      and only a few where they were the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It gets more common when you are taking many, many data points. If you have a thousand
      plants, the mean, median, and mode will often get very close to the same number, and it will
      start representing the plants better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A lot of plants will be medium-sized?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, and a few will be extremely big or small. We see a lot of distributions in science with
      a lump in the middle and long tails trailing out to either side. Height, weight, number of
      kernels on a corncob, intelligence... all these make the same shape. Can you think of some?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Speed of cars on a highway? Time it takes Derby horses to finish?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In all these graphs, the important numbers are the average -- whichever average you use --
      and the standard deviation, which you can experiment with in the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/NormalDistribution' | relative_url }}">Normal Distribution Activity</a> .
    </p>
