      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So you say we're going to look for familiar
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractals</a> in Pascal's Triangle. What is Pascal's Triangle??
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's look at a simple problem that Pascal was interested in (in the seventeenth
      century). It involves probability and chance, concepts which Pascal helped to develop. Here's
      the problem:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>What are the chances that a family of X children will have Y girls? </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at a few possible values of X and Y. Here's a table:
    </p>
    <p>
      <table class="center prettyTable">
        <tr>
          <td>
            Number of Children
          </td>
          <td>
            Number of Girls
          </td>
          <td />
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 0
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 0
          </td>
          <td>
            The chances are 1 out of 1 in this trival case, because if we know that there are no
            children, we know there are no girls. We don't have to check Y = 1 or anything else
            since one or more girls in a family of no children is nonsensical.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 1
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 0
          </td>
          <td>
            Let's see; if we know there is 1 child, then it is either a girl or a boy. So, the
            chances are 1 out of 2 the child is a girl -- and the same for a boy.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 1
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 1
          </td>
          <td>
            Same as the last: one child, one girl: 1 out of 2. We don't have to check Y = 2 or
            higher because that can't happen.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 2
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 0
          </td>
          <td>
            Now it gets more interesting! With two children we can have no girls (so two boys), an
            older girl and a younger boy, a younger girl and an older boy, or two girls. All the
            possibilities can be summarized as: BB, BG, GB, GG. The chances that there are no girls
            (Y = 0) is 1 out of 4.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 2
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 1
          </td>
          <td>
            We summarized the situation above. One girl happens 2 out of 4 times.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X = 2
          </td>
          <td>
            Y = 2
          </td>
          <td>
            Again, look at the cases above. Two girls happens 1 out of 4 times. As before, we're
            done with families of 2 children because Y = 3 would be impossible.
          </td>
        </tr>

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Each number in this table is the number of ways that many girls can happen? So the second 10
      in row 5 means that there are 10 different ways to have three girls in 5 children?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. Can you find all of these arrangements?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see;

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very Good! Now, can you tell me -- without writing out all of the arrangements -- what row 6
      would look like? Here's a big hint. Rewrite the table as a triangle, and look at how each
      number is
    </p>
    <p>
      related to the two above it:
      <div class="h-center">
        <pre>
                                1
   	                    1       1

   	            1       3       3       1
   	        1       4       6       4       1
   	    1       5       10      10      5       1
        </pre>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Cool! The next row should be 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 -- you just add the two above.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. This is Pascal's Triangle. We really should call it Zhu Shijie's Triangle, since
      Zhu, a Chinese mathematician from the fourteenth century, discovered it three hundred years
      before Pascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many interesting number patterns in this triangle. Try
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ColoringMultiples' | relative_url }}">Coloring Multiples</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ColoringRemainder' | relative_url }}">Coloring Remainders</a> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So Pascal's Triangle is used for calculating the chances of having a certain number of girls
      in a family?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is just one of many uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In
          <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">combinatorics</a> and counting, we can use these numbers whenever we need to know the number of ways we can
          choose Y things from a group of X things. For example, if we need to choose 3 people to
          work on a problem together and we have 5 people to choose from, there are "5 choose 3" or
          10 different ways to do this -- Using the fifth row, third entry in the triangle. This is
          the same idea as for the "number of girls in a family" problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          In algebra, we can use these numbers to figure out what a binomial raised to a power will
          be. Suppose we are taking (A + B) and raising it to the power 5. How does this work? We
          need to remember that the power 5 can be thought of as repeated multiplication, so we must
          find
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      (A + B)(A + B)(A + B)(A + B)(A + B)
    </p>
    <p>
      This would be a mess to do, since we would have to use the distributive property over and over
      again. BUT!!! Pascal showed how his triangle gives the numbers needed to write this out after
      multiplication. The power is 5 so use row 5 to get:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/image4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      See how the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">coefficients</a> (that's the math term for the numbers in front of the letters in the expression) are just the
      numbers from row 5 of the triangle? So we write the power combinations in order (think of the
      "number of girls" problem) all A's (no B's), 4 A's (1 B), three A's, etc., up to no A's and
      then use the table for the coefficients.
    </p>
