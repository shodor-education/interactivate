    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There is one more family of quadrilaterals that we need to talk about. I need to tell you
      about trapezoids. Trapezoids have exactly one pair of opposite sides that are parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are those opposite sides
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">congruent</a> too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> They don't have to be. A trapezoid can look like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Trapezoids-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, so the other sides can look any way that you want them to?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. However, the other sides cannot be
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallel</a> because we say that trapezoids have
      <strong>exactly</strong> one pair of parallel sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yeah, because if it had 2 pairs of parallel sides then it would be a parallelogram!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's very perceptive of you! Do you all remember what we called a triangle that had two
      congruent sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's an isosceles triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. So what do you think we call a trapezoid in which the two non-parallel sides are
      congruent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> An isosceles trapezoid?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! Can you draw one of those?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think it would look like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/Trapezoids-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very nice. Does everyone understand what trapezoids are now? You know many types of
      quadrilaterals now!
