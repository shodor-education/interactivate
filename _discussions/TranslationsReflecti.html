      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We all know that we see our "reflection" in a mirror. If I draw a triangle on the board and
      this "mirror," what would the reflection look like?
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, I think that it would look just the same on the other side of the line. Like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> If I make an "X" on this line on the original triangle, where would it be on the reflected
      triangle?
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, when we reflected the triangle, we sort of flipped it over that "mirror," or the line,
      so it would be on the opposite side of the triangle, like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! We call that line the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/l' | relative_url }}">line of symmetry</a>. See, the picture is symmetrical in respect to the line. Now that we know what it means to
      reflect an object, what do you think it means to
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">rotate</a> an object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> I think it means that we just turn it. Kind of like putting the object on a plate, and then
      spinning the plate around while the plate's center stays in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's good. The center of the object doesn't have to be at the center of rotation i.e. The
      center of your plate. Any point can be used to mark the center of rotation. Do you see I've
      put an "x" on one of the vertices of the triangle? Can you draw what this triangle would look
      like if we rotated it 90 degrees around this vertex?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> I think it would look like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very nice. And also, it is customary that the angle of rotation is measured in a
      counterclockwise direction, just like you drew it. Now we have one more transformation that we
      can do. Who can guess what it means to
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">translate</a> an object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 4:</span> Is that like moving it over?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! A translation is like sliding the object over a certain distance. If I translated this
      triangle about 14 cm, who could draw what it would look like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 4:</span> I think it would look like this:
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/TranslationsReflecti-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very nicely done! Thank you for including the "x" on the appropriate side of the triangle.
    </p>
