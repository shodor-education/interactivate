      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Tell me about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">recursion</a>. Is it the same as iteration or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Recursion is a special kind of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">iteration</a>. Here's the idea: With a recursion we are given starting information and a rule for how to
      use it to get new information. Then we repeat the rule using the new information as though it
      were the starting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So we have a loop? What comes out of the rule goes back into the rule for the next iteration?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a good way to think about it. Here's a classic example of a recursion which cranks out
      a sequence of numbers called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">Fibonacci Numbers</a>:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have starting information and a rule for generating a new value. The n increases by
      one each time, so we can ask questions like
      <em>find the ninth fibonacci number</em>. We are given two starting values since each new value is calculated from the two previous
      ones. Try generating the ninth number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's see. The first numbers are 1 and 1, as given. The rule says to take the two previous
      numbers and add them to get the new number, so I would get:
