      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Consider the problem from before: "We started our math lesson at 10 a.m. It is now 11 a.m.
      How long have we been doing math?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, and the fancy name for the time that has passed is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">elapsed time</a>. How do we figure out the elapsed time in a problem like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I just subtracted: 11-10=1 hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a really good method. Look at this problem: "If it's 1 p.m. now and I got to school at
      8 a.m., how long have I been at school?" How would solve a problem like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would probably just count. 1 hour until 9, 2 hours until 10, 3 hours until 11, 4 hours
      until 12, 5 hours until 1. 5 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Those are both really good methods of solving problems, but you can't forget that there are
      sometimes minutes as well as hours in these problems. Try this one: "If you started eating
      lunch at 11:45 and finished at 12:05, how much time is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would solve that problem by adding the minutes. 15 minutes to 12:00, and 5 more minutes to
      12:05. That's 20 minutes total.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! Can you think of another way to solve it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You could subtract.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How can you subract. You can't borrow like you normally would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You could take 1 hour and turn it into minutes. That would give you 11 hours and 60+5
      minutes, 65. Then you subtract: 65-45=20 minutes. And 11-11=0 hours. So the answer is 20
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! Now you're ready for some really tricky problems.
    </p>
