      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">set</a> is a group of elements that all share something in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So can you organize items by sets?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes you can, organizing items by sets can make looking at a large group of things easier. Can
      you think of a place that organizes things by sets?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes the grocery store is organized by sets, each aisle represents a different set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! So what are some sets or aisles that we find in the grocery store?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well there's the frozen foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Ok, Can you think of sets that make up the frozen foods?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Yes, there are frozen vegetables, desserts, fruits, and meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! Each item that belongs to a set is called an element when looked at as an
      individual item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Ok so an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">element</a> could be an apple pie, which would belong in the set desserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! An element is a single object, but within the set food, you have several other sets.
      Can you think of a smaller set that an apple pie could fit in?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Yes. Apple pie could fit into a set for round foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Or a set for foods with fruit in them or even foods that are baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, one element can belong in many sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor"> Student 1:</span> Blue is an element of the set colors but a smaller set that blue belongs to would be cool
      colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now that you have an understanding of how to find what set an element fits into, can you give
      me a list of elements that all belong in the same set? Think about a set other than colors and
      fruits since we already discussed those.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> A set could be school supplies, and the elements can be pencil, pen, glue, markers, and
      scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Can someone name a set within that set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Yes, writing utensils, which would include pencils, pens, and markers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I think you've got the hang of it! Great job!
    </p>
