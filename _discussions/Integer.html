      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What exactly is an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">integer</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, you know what the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">natural numbers</a> are, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, the natural numbers are the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. The integers are a set of numbers including the natural numbers as well as zero
      and the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">negative numbers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The negative numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, the negative numbers are the opposite of the natural numbers, also called positive
      numbers, and are usually expressed as -x (if x is a natural number). Think about it like this:
      if the number 5 is greater than zero by five units, then -5 is less than zero by five units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So that means that a positive number is always greater than its negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, and furthermore it means that any positive number is greater than any negative
      number. It is also interesting to note that as a positive number gets larger as its negative
      counterpart gets smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then that means -8 is less than -3 since 8 is greater than 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It seems like you understand. Now, can you think of a situation where you would use negative
      numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Wouldn't you use negative numbers if, for instance, you owed more money than you had in your
      account. If you were in debt $300, then the amount of money you have could be represented as
      -$300.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's good, but can you think up one more example just to be certain you understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, in golf negative numbers are used to describe how many strokes a player is below par.
      For instance, if you were 5 strokes below par, your score could be expressed as -5, or "five
      under par".
