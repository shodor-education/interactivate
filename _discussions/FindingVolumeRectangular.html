      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> How can we find out how much a three dimensional object can hold inside (its
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">volume</a>)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, there are different methods for finding volume depending on the three dimensional
      shape. Let's first look at a box-like shape. How do you think we should solve for the volume
      of this shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, we find the area of a rectangle by multiplying length times width and that shows us how
      much of a flat rectangle is filled, so maybe we do something like that to find the volume of a
      three dimensional rectangular shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Good thinking! You are very close. A flat shape is called a two-dimensional shape because it
      has two dimensions (in the case of a rectangle they are called length and width) while a three
      dimensional shape will have three dimensions. Let's look at a three dimensional rectangular
      shape (a rectangular prism):
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/FindingVolumeRectangular-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>This shape has a length and a width just like you mentioned flat rectangles having, but what
      else does this three dimensional shape have that flat shapes don't have? What is the extra
      dimension?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> There is another side that shows you how deep it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! This is called the depth! The depth is what makes this a three dimensional figure
      since there are three dimensions: length, width, and depth! All three of these dimensions are
      used to find the volume of a rectangular prism. To find the area of a two dimensional
      rectangle we multiply length by width so lets start with finding the area of a two dimensional
      part of the rectangular prism. We will first look at the top layer of the rectangular prism
      when there is length and width, but no depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is the length (also sometimes called the height) of this shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> 3! There are three cubes along the sides going up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Mentor: Great, so the length is 3. Now what is the width?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span>The width is 5! There are five cubes along the sides going left and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right! Now we can find the area of this flat shape. What do I do to find the area?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> You multiply the length (3) by the width (5). The answer is 15!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We need to include the depth!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, let's take another look at our three dimensional shape:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/FindingVolumeRectangular-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>See the flat rectangular shape we looked at is only one layer of this big shape. Think about
      it like this: the flat shape that we just looked at is stacked on other shapes identical to
      itself. How many of the flat shapes are stacked up in this 3 dimensional figure?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span>So our third dimension, depth, is 4?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Yes. Now, knowing that in the three dimensional shape there are four layers of the flat shape
      we looked at, and knowing that the flat shape has an area of 15 blocks, how do you think we
      will find the volume?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> If there are four layers, each with an area of 15, we can add 15+15+15+15 and that will give
      us the total volume!
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We could also multiply the area of the flat shape, 15, by 4. That is the same thing as adding
      an area of 15 four times.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Right! And what do you get when you multiply 15 by 4?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> 60! The volume of the rectangular prism is 60!
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>Great job! You found the volume of a rectangular prism. Here are the steps that we took to
      find our answer:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Length x Width = Area of the flat rectangular shape
        </li>
        <li>
          Area x Depth = Volume of the rectangular prism
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So, in order to find the volume of a rectangular prism we multiply length by width by depth.
    </p>
    <p />
