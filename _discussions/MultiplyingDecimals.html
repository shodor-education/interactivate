      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I remember that a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">decimal number</a> is a number that is in between two integers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right, but do you remember how decimal numbers are written?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They have a decimal point and then some more numbers to show how much bigger than the integer
      they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's very good. What do those numbers after the decimal point represent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's like a fraction where the denominator is a power of ten. For example, twenty-five
      hundredths is written as 0.25 or .25 as a decimal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great example! Now do you recall how to multiply decimal numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's like multiplying regular numbers only you have to add the decimal point when you're
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, do you remember how to determine where the decimal goes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think that you count all the decimal places on the numbers that you multiplied together and
      that's how many places are in the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. So if I multiplied 0.25 by 0.1, how many decimal places would the final answer have?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Three!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Okay, so what is that result?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um, hang on... it's .025?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now who can tell me how to multiply decimal numbers if they're greater than 1?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Its the same as multiplying with smaller decimal numbers, you count the number of decimal
      places in the original problem and that is how many there are in the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's correct too but you do need to be careful not to count trailing zeros. For instance,
      if you have 1.25 multiplied by 1.50 how many decimal places should be in your final answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There would only be three because the number 1.50 has a trailing zero so that shouldn't be
      counted as a decimal place. So the final answer is 1.875.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. What about multiplying 1.25 by 1.05?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There would be four decimal places because the 0 in 1.05 is not a trailing zero. The answer
      to 1.25 x 1.05 is 1.3125.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's try one more. What if you have 1.2 x 2.5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There would be two decimal places because there's no trailing zero. The answer is 3.00, which
      is the same as 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sounds like you've got the hang of it!
    </p>
