    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I do not understand the idea of solving for "x".
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's look at a specific problem where we have to solve for x:
  </p>
  <div class="h-center">
    4 = x + 3
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I just don't understand what the problem is asking me to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, in this problem "x" represents a number. Since we don't know what the number is we are
    using a letter to stand in its place.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so I'm trying to find out what number "x" is representing?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, to do this we should think about the problem for a second. This problem is saying that if
    you add three to the unknown number ("x"), then you get 4. Do you know what that would mean "x"
    is?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The number 4 is only one more than 3 so that means that "x" is 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Lets check our work. We'll replace "x" with the number you just found that it represents. Is
    this number sentence true: 4 = (1) + 3?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's look at a more complicated problem:
  </p>
  <div class="h-center">
    22 = x - 13
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know what number you take 13 away from to get 22.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well for problems like this where the answer does not pop out at you, we try to get "x" on one
    side of the equals sign by itself to find the answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What does that mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> On one side of the equals sign you will have the "x" (it can be either the right side or the
    left side) and on the other side of the equals sign you will have the numbers in the equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How do you get "x" by itself? In this problem we would want to get the 13 away from the side
    with the "x" so that the "x" will be by itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There is a number that we can add to the expression x - 13 to get rid of the 13. If we add 13
    to the negative 13 then we would have x - 13 + 13. We get x + 0 which is just x.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You can just add any number to the equation?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You can add any number to one side of the equation as long as you add the same amount to the
    other side of the equation. You have to do the same thing to both sides in order to keep the
    values on both sides of the equals sign equal to one another. This is like a balance. If you add
    or take away something from one side of the balance it would become unbalanced. But if you do it
    to the other side, it becomes balanced again.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That makes sense! So adding the 13 to the other side with the number 22, the problem would look
    like this:
  </p>
  <div class="h-center">
    13 + 22 = x + 0
  </div>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, and now we do the simple operations. What is 13 + 22?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 35. So x = 35!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! Let's check that to be sure. If we replace the "x" in the equation 22 = x - 13 with our
    answer, 35, we get 22 = 35 - 13. Is that a true statement?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's try another problem that looks a little different:
    <div class="h-center">
      16 = 8x
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is different about this problem?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, instead of having a number added to the "x", there is a number in front of the "x". I
    think that means that you should multiply "x" and the 8.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. The 8 is the coefficient of the "x".
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So we are trying to find a number that when you multiply it by "x" you get 16.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. Remember earlier that we needed to get the "x" by itself on one side of the equals
    sign? Well, we still need to do that, but we won't use addition or subtraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Couldn't we use division? Since it is 8 times "x", the opposite of multiplication is division
    and we could divide.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. We will divide both sides by the coefficient of "x".
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 16 divided by 8 is 2, so that is what is on the left side. What is on the right side?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, we have to divide both sides by 8 for it to remain balanced. What is 8 divided by 8?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> One. And then there is the x. So 2 = x. Cool!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's check our answer:
    <div class="h-center">
      16 = 8 * (2)
      <br />
      16 = 16
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are right. Now whenever you have a problem with a coefficient of x, you will divide by the
    coefficient. Let's practice!
  </p>
