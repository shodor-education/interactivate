      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you come up with several fair ways to randomly choose a number from 1 to 3? From 1 to 5?
      From 1 to
      <strong>N</strong>? (That means your method should work for
      <strong>any</strong> number.)

      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We can put as many numbered balls in a bag as we want, and pull one out each time we need a
      random number:

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> Or we can build a spinner:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Indeed, all these methods will work for any number. We can also use a computer program to
      give us numbers in a fair way. These programs, not surprisingly, are called
