      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Please draw the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">coordinate axis</a> on your paper. Now label the x and y-axis. Now label each line on the x and y axis with a
      scale of one.

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Did you know that the coordinate axis is a plane?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No. What is a plane?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A plane is a flat surface that continues out infinitely. The best way to see what a plane is
      like is to imagine a piece of paper that never ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So does
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">infinity</a> mean never ending?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes it does. Infinity represents something that has the potential to keep going. For any
      given value a larger value can always be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So a plane stretches out to the end of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, but more than that. The end of the universe represents an ending. Something that can be
      considered infinite does not end. In actuallity nothing that exists can be infinite. It just
      has the potential to continue like our number system or a line. Now, can any one remember what
      a line is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A line is made up of at least two points that are on a straight path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, very good. Let's draw one.
    </p>

        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/LinesRaysLineSegment-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now, does anyone have an idea of what a ray is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The beam of light that comes out of a ray gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good idea. A ray gun has a starting point and it goes on forever if it never hits its target.
      A ray starts at one point and it continues out to infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's draw a ray.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/LinesRaysLineSegment-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So, what is the difference between a line and a ray?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A line goes on to infinity in both directions, but a ray stops on one end. If you cut a line
      in half, you make two rays. Now, can anyone guess what a line segment is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is it a line with two ends?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly right. A line segment is part of a line that has two endpoints. Let's draw one on
      paper.
