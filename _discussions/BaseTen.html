      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Tell me what you know about base ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know about base ten blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Then tell me about those.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You use them to show numbers. There are little cubes, those represent 1. Then there are long
      sticks that have ten of the cubes in them. Those represent 10. Then there are these squares
      that have ten of the sticks in them. They represent 100.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's exactly right. But how do you use them to show numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You take some sticks, let's use 4. That means that you have 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you know it's 40?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because it's 4 groups of ten. That's 4 x 10 = 40. There are 40.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So you have 40. Now what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then you could add 4 of the cubes. If you put the 4 sticks with the 4 cubes, you get a
      number: 44.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You've got it, exactly. To do that, you're using base 10. That just means that there will be
      10 cubes in your sticks and 10 sticks in your square, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But why do we need a fancy name for that? Everyone knows there are 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Imagine that I had something I called "base two blocks". How many cubes would make up a stick
      then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know. Probably 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! In base 2, there are 2 cubes in a stick, and 2 sticks in a square. Imagine that
      you had 3 cubes in base 10. How would you show this in base 2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, you'd have to put 2 of the cubes together to make a stick. Then you'd have a leftover
      cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! What would you call that number you just showed me with base 2 blocks?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, it's not 3. In base 2, 3 doesn't exist. Think about sticks and cubes again. Pretend like
      that stick is just like a base 10 stick. What would you call the number?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> In base 10, if you have 1 stick and 1 cube, you put the 1 for the stick in the ten's place,
      and the 1 for the cube in the one's place and you get 11. But it's not 11, so I don't know
      what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You do it exactly like that. In base 2, you count the sticks, and put that number in
      something we'll call the two's place. Then count the cubes and put that number in the one's
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But it's not eleven!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It's not eleven in base 10, no. We know that it's 3. But in base 2, we write the number like
      this: 11. Do you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think so. If we were writing the number 2 in base two, would we write it like this: 10?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Now you're ready to try more difficult numbers!
    </p>
