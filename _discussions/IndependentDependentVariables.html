      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Today we are going to discuss independent and dependent variables. What does it mean for
      something to be independent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That means that it doesn't depend on anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! So what do you think it means for a variable to be independent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Maybe that variable doesn't depend on the other variables or numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct. In mathematical terms, we call a variable independent if its value can be set
      arbitrarily to get a result. This is known as the
      <em>input</em> of a function. Do you know what I mean by "input"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's the variable that you start with. You know that variable, then you do something to it,
      and you get the "output".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, and we represent the variables with
      <em>x</em> and
      <em>y</em>. When you input a value of
      <em>x</em> into an equation, you get a value for
      <em>y</em>. So if
      <em>x</em> is the independent variable, what identity does
      <em>y</em> have?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Since
      <em>y</em> is the output of the function, I guess
      <em>y</em> would be the dependent variable. Its value is dependent on whatever the value of
      <em>x</em> is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right,
      <em>y</em> is the dependent variable because we do not set a value of
      <em>y</em> directly; instead, we set a value of
      <em>x</em> and use that to find the value of
      <em>y</em>. Consider this simple equation as an example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IndependentDependentVariables-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In this equation, what are the independent and dependent variables?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, for any value of
      <em>x</em>, you have to multiply it by two and then add one to get
      <em>y</em>, so
      <em>y</em> is dependent on
      <em>x</em>. The independent variable is
      <em>x</em>, and the dependent variable is
      <em>y</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Indeed. It is relatively easy to identify the independent and dependent variables in a simple
      two-variable equation, but what do you make of this equation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IndependentDependentVariables-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yikes! I don't know what to do with more than two variables. I guess
      <em>y</em> would still be the dependent variable, but I don't know which of
      <em>x</em> and
      <em>z</em> is the independent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right on both counts.
      <em>x</em> and
      <em>z</em> are both independent variables. You can change either variable to any value before
      determining the value of
      <em>y</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Okay, I think I've got it. The variable that's alone is the dependent variable, all other
      variables are independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right, but what if I change the equation around a bit? What happens when I solve the
      equation for
      <em>z</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IndependentDependentVariables-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then...
      <em>z</em> is the dependent variable, and
      <em>x</em> and
      <em>y</em> are independent. But I thought you said that
      <em>y</em> was the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I did say that, but the independent and dependent variables are not so immutable as they
      might seem from an algebraic perspective. With any equation, you can arbitrarily set any
      variable as the dependent variable, and then set all others as independent variables. In fact,
      what you've learned about dependent and independent variables has very little to do with pure
      algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then why bother? Why not just randomly pick out variables to be independent and dependent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Consider the idea of driving a car. The acceleration of the car changes based on the pressure
      you put on the accelerator and the brake, approximated by the equation:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IndependentDependentVariables-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Where
      <em>a</em> is the acceleration,
      <em>p</em> is the pressure on the accelerator, and
      <em>b</em> is the pressure on the brake. In this equation, what is the dependent variable?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Acceleration,
      <em>a</em> is dependent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, but even if I rearranged the equation to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IndependentDependentVariables-discussion-5.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It wouldn't make any sense to say that the pressure you put on the brake depends on your
      acceleration. Clearly, it is acceleration that depends on braking, not the other way around.
      And pressure on the brake certainly doesn't depend on pressure on the accelerator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So I guess when you are talking about real-world phenomena, the idea of independent and
      dependent variables becomes more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Especially when you start learning to perform scientific experiments, the idea of
      independent and dependent variables will be important conceptually, even if it is not
      important algebraically.
