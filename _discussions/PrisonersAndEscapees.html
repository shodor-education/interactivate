    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">Mandelbrot Set</a> is made up of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/j' | relative_url }}">Julia Sets</a>, which are prisoner sets. What is a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">prisoner</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is a simplified description, but you have all the main ideas. Let's talk about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">prisoners</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">escapees</a>, and Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou.
    </p>
    <p>
      After World War I, Julia and Fatou were interested in iterating two variable (or complex)
      equations using
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">recursion</a>. They chose an equation and iterated it using various starting points. Mathematicians call
      this sort of problem a
      <em>dynamical system </em>. They found that if you looked at different starting points, different behaviors would
      emerge. Let's look at the simplest interesting case:
    </p>
    <p>
      f(Z) = Z^2 + C
    </p>
    <p>
      where C is any point (complex number) inside the circle of radius 2. We are only interested in
      those points because that is where we will be looking for the Mandelbrot set eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an experiment to try: Let C = (0,0) and start with the point (0,1). What happens?
    </p>

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. Try another starting point: (1,1) with the same C = (0,0).

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Actually, mathematics tells us that when the point gets outside of the circle of radius
      2, it must "escape." So, you didn't have to go as far as you did to tell.

    <p>
      I don't need to go any further; the first number will just get closer to 0 with each
      iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Now you have seen all of the ideas needed to understand prisoners and escapees.
      The three behaviors above are exactly what Julia and Fatou noticed about all kinds of
      functions of the form Z^2 + C. The iterations either:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Get closer and closer to 0 -- we say they
          <em>approach 0 </em>. These are the
          <strong>prisoners</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get larger and larger -- we say they
          <em>
           approach
            <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">infinity</a>
          </em>
          <strong>escapees</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get trapped -- these points are the boundary points between the prisoners and escapees.
          The set of all of these points for a function is called the
          <em>Julia Set</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So for the function f(Z) = Z^2 + (0,0) the point (1,1) is an escapee, the point (1/2,1/2) is
      a prisoner and the point (0,1) is in the middle between?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! It turns out that for the function f(Z) = Z^2 + (0,0), the Julia set is the circle of
      radius 1 centered at (0,0). Every point inside the circle is a prisoner, every point outside
      the circle is an escapee, and every point on the circle is neither!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Surely this isn't some sort of fractal?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right. BUT! change the C to something other than (0,0) and you get really weird Julia
      sets. Try iterating a few different f(Z) = Z^2 + C functions using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/TwoVariableFunction' | relative_url }}">Two Variable Function Pump</a> and then have a look at some Julia sets using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/JuliaSets' | relative_url }}">Julia Set Builder</a> . In the Julia set builder, the black set is the prisoner set and the colors around the
      prisoners are the escapees. The colors are chosen depending on how many iterations it took the
      starting point to get out of the circle of radius 2 -- which guarantees that it escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the more famous Julia sets are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          C = (-1,0)
        </li>
        <li>
          C = (0,-1) -- the Dendrite
        </li>
        <li>
          C = (1/2, 0)
        </li>
        <li>
          C = (-0.1, 0.8) -- the Rabbit
        </li>
        <li>
          C = (.36, .1) -- the Dragon
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      One last comment: Julia sets are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">chaotic</a> as well as fractal! The iterates for the points in the Julia set (the border between
      prisoners and escapees) jump around in very irregular ways, and if we change to another point
      close by in the Julia set, the behavior can be completely different. Remember that this is
      exactly what chaos was: Small changes in the starting point can produce large changes in the
      results. Again we see how something chaotic ends up having a predictable overall pattern!
