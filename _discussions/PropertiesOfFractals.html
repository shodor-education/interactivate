    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I've seen lots of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractals</a> now; what makes a fractal a fractal???
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's list the properties they all have in common:
      <ul>
        <li>
          All were built by starting with an "initiator" and "iterating" using a "generator." So we
          used
          <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">recursion</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some aspect of the limiting object was
          <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">infinite</a> (length, perimeter, surface area) -- Many of the objects got "crinklier."
        </li>
        <li>
          Some aspect of the limiting object stayed finite or 0 (area, volume, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          At any
          <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">iteration</a>, a piece of the object is a scaled down, otherwise identical copy of the previous
          iteration (
          <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">self-similar</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> These are the characteristics that Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term) ascribed to
      <em>
        <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">Regular Fractals</a>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why call 'em fractals??
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Mandelbrot used that word because in Latin, fractus means broken. Mandelbrot viewed these
      things as being highly irregular and crinkley. Another good reason to use the word fractal is
      that they have fractional dimension! Before I can explain that, we need to talk about
      <link href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/dimen.html">Dimension and Scale</a>.
