    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is there a way to calculate the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">area</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">perimeter</a> of these objects without having to count everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes there is, let's look at an example. The first step is to "box" the object in. Then count
      the length and width of the "box".
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ShapeExplorer-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the length is 4 and the width is 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The area of a rectangle is length times width. So, who can tell me the area of the "box"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ShapeExplorer-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The area of the box is four times five, which is twenty. But what does that have to do with
      the area of the shape inside?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question. How many squares are there in the "box" that are not a part of the object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are six squares in the "box" that are not a part of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The area of the object is the area of the "box" minus the squares that are not part of the
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The area of this object is twenty minus six, which equals fourteen. This method does reduce
      the amount of counting a little. But, what about the perimeter of the shape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question! Now, let's find the perimeter of the "box". Perimeter is the distance around
      "the box". The distance around the "box" is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ShapeExplorer-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the perimeter is two times four plus two times five.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes it is. Remember that we multiply first and then add according to the order of operations.
      So the perimeter of the "box" is eight plus ten, which equals eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Now we know what the perimeter of "the box" is, but what does that have to do with the
      perimeter of the object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> They are the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why would they be the same? That doesn't make any sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It makes sense if you look at the picture as the number of perimeter lines per row and
      column. The numbers in blue are the perimeter lines of the object in that column or row and
      the red numbers are the number of perimeter lines of the "box".
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ShapeExplorer-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can see that the perimeter of the "box" is actually the perimeter of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Cool, does that trick work for all shapes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, this trick doesn't work for shapes that fold back on themselves. Adding one block to our
      example makes the trick not work. Can anyone figure out what makes our trick not work?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ShapeExplorer-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Before you said that we should look at the picture as the number of perimeter lines per row
      and column. In this picture the number of perimeter lines of the shape does not match the
      number of perimeter lines of the "box".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great Job! In the first column there are four shape perimeter lines and the "box" only has
      two. So the perimeter of the object is two more than the perimeter of the "box". So the
      perimeter of the shape is eighteen plus two, which is twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So when the picture folds on itself, we have to scan the columns and the rows to see how many
      extra perimeter lines there are. Then we just add that to the perimeter of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! Now let's play with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ShapeExplorer' | relative_url }}">Shape Explorer</a> applet and see how well our method works.
    </p>
