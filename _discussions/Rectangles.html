      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So, what's the difference between a rectangle and a square?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's see. They both have 4 sides, but are the sides the same length?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um, in a square it looks like all the sides are the same. But in a rectangle, only two of the
      sides are the same. I mean, the opposite sides are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's good. So all the sides of a square are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">congruent</a>, or have equal lengths, and only the opposite sides of the rectangle must be congruent. Are
      there any other parts of the squares and rectangles that seem to be the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The opposite sides are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallel</a>, like in a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">parallelogram</a>, only they go straight up in the air. They don't lean to the side like some parallelograms
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, rectangles and squares ARE parallelograms. By noticing that all sides "go straight up
      in the air," You noticed, that the angles in the rectangle and square are the same. Do you
      remember what we call angles that are straight up like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think that they are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">right angles</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! (ha ha) That is to say, you are correct. So rectangles and squares have how many right
      angles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They have 4 right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now, can we make a general rule to determine what defines a rectangle and a square?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> First, each shape has to have 4 right angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. What do we need to say about the sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We need to say that they are parallel and that in a square all four sides are congruent while
      in a rectangle only the opposite sides are congruent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Okay, so a rectangle must have opposite sides that are parallel and equal and four right
      angles. A square must have opposite sides parallel, all sides congruent, and four right
      angles. We could also say that a rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles, while a
      square is a parallelogram with four congruent sides and four right angles. But wait! Does that
      mean that a square is a rectangle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, by our definition it is since it has opposite sides that are congruent and parallel and
      it has four right angles. Did we define it wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, actually you did it perfectly. A square IS a rectangle. Can anyone tell me why a
      rectangle is NOT a square?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A rectangle is not a square because it is not required to have
      <strong>four</strong> congruent sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! Now we can talk about
