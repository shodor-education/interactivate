      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Please, draw a straight horizontal line at the center of your graphing paper. As we count:
      "Zero, one, two, three.." we put the numbers on the line, one number per line of the graph
      paper. When we count backwards, we distinguish the numbers that come before zero by placing a
      "-" sign in front of them, so it goes: "Two, one, zero..." Make sure that you evenly space the
      numbers, since the distance from 1 to 2 should be the same as the distance from 2 to 3.

      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Minus one, minus two, minus three...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What we have now is called a "number line" or "coordinate line." It can be used to describe
      where a point is on the line. To give the exact "address" of a point, we just look at how far
      the point is from zero, using a minus symbol for numbers to the left of zero. Except we don't
      call it a minus sign, we refer to these numbers as "negative."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So the address of this point (Student highlights 4) is 4, and the address of this point
      (Student highlights -5) is
      <em>negative</em> 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Excellent. Now we want to get more freedom of movement. We will let our points be anywhere on
      the paper, not only on the line. To give an address for the points that are not on the number
      line we will need to make a vertical number line. Draw a vertical line through the zero of the
      horizontal number line. Now label it with positive numbers above the horizontal number line
      and the negative numbers below the horizontal number line. Instead of saying horizontal number
      line and vertical number line all the time let's call them by their mathematical names. The
      horizontal number line is called the x-axis and the vertical number line is y-axis.

      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, I would go up three blocks and then right two blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sure. How else can we get there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We can first go two blocks to the right, and then three blocks up.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Or we can go one right, three up, and one more right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are many ways to get from one point to another point (how many ways, by the way?). To
      create a standard way of referring to points, mathematicians came to an agreement that they
      will always name the point after one special way of walking. Starting from zero, we go all the
      way to the right or to the left, counting steps: one, two. Then we go up or down: one, two
      three steps up. Then we write the number of steps like that: (2,3). Again, the first number is
      "left-right," the second "up-down." A negative sign means either left or down. So, if our
      point is (-2, -3), we go two steps to the left, and then three steps down. Do you remember the
      names of our number lines?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, the horizontal line is called the x-axis and the vertical line is called the y-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can any one think of a better way to describe the address of a point instead of (left-right,
      up-down)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Could we call the address by the names of the lines?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, so the address of a point would be described as (x,y) instead of (left-right, up-down).
      The mathematical term for the address of a point is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">coordinates</a>. Now does everyone see how the x-axis and y-axis divide our paper into four sections?

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes and I bet they have names too!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are right! These sections are called quadrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are they called quadrants because there are four of them and there are four sides to a
      quadralateral?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good observation! We get our prefix "quad" from the Latin word "quattuor" which means four.
      Each of these quadrants are referred to by a roman numeral.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The first quadrant</strong> contains all the points with positive x and positive y coordinates and is represented by
          the roman numeral I.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> The second quadrant</strong> contains all the points with negative x and positive y coordinates and is represented by
          the roman numeral II.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> The third quadrant</strong> contains all the points with negative x and negative y coordinates and is represented by
          the roman numeral III.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The fourth quadrant</strong> contains all the points with positive x and negative y coordinates and is represented by
          the roman numeral IV.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Will any point that has an address of (positive, negative) be in the fourth quadrant?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, but let's use the correct vocabulary. Any point that has coordinates of (positive,
      negative) is in the fourth quadrant.
    </p>
