      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">irregular fractals</a> I made using
      <a href="{{ '/activities/FlakeMaker' | relative_url }}">Flake Maker</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/FracturedPictures' | relative_url }}">Fractured Pictures</a> are much more complicated than the regular fractals that I made earlier with tools like the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/KochSnowflake' | relative_url }}">Koch Snowflake</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/activities/HilbertCurve' | relative_url }}">Hilbert Curve</a> . How do I calculate the fractal dimension for these? What is the scale factor (S) and the
      number of pieces (N)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for you on the dimension of irregular fractals. The
      basic formula must be generalized using some fairly complicated mathematics, and in many cases
      -- especially with some of the
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/PrisonersAndEscapees' | relative_url }}">Julia Sets</a> we'll look at later -- the fractional dimension is unknown. There are even situations in
      which we can show that the dimension is fractional, but not what the fraction actually is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So if the number of pieces in the replacement and the scale factor both stay the same at each
      stage, I can use

    <p>
      to calculate the dimension D, but if something changes, I can't?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. It's almost always the scale factor that messes us up.
