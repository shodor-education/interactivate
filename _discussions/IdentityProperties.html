      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's start out with an easy question: What is 4 - 4?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> It's zero, right? Why are you asking us such a simple problem when we have been trying to
      "solve for x" for the last few days?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Zero is correct and my question does actually relate to what we have been doing. Look at this
      problem:
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Where do you see 4 - 4 is this problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, to solve for x you need to subtract four from each side. That would be 4 - 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why are we subtracting four?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> To get rid of the four on the right side of the equation and isolate x, like we have been
      doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Okay, we are going to subtract four from each side to keep it balanced, but what did you tell
      me earlier was the answer to 4 - 4?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Okay. On the left side we have 2 - 4, which is what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Negative two. So you have -2 = x.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is what we have been doing thus far, but you just told me several times that 4 - 4 is
      zero, so I am going to write that down. So I have:
      <div class="h-center">
        -2 = x + 0
      </div>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I am pretty sure that the answer is -2. Can we just get rid of that zero?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well yes, but in so doing we actually use a specific property. Tell me, what is special about
      zero when you add it to other numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, it represents nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is true. How does that relate to addition?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> You can add zero to any number and nothing changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>You are exactly right. Zero is a special number in addition because it can be added to
      anything and it doesn't change the value. It is called the additive
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">identity</a>. If we use the property that anything plus zero equals the first value, we have:
      <div class="h-center">
        x = -2
      </div>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There is also a multiplicative identity. Will someone try to define a multiplicative
      identity?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Maybe it is something that you can multiply numbers by and get the same numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is a pretty good definition. The multiplicative identity is a number that can be
      multiplied by a given value and the result is that given value. Does anyone know a number with
      that property?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> It can't be zero because 6 * 0 = 0, not 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I think it is one, because 6 * 1 = 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Does everyone agree that one is the multiplicative identity? Can anyone think of a number
      that when you multiply it by 1 does NOT give you back that value?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> No. I don't think there is such a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are correct, 1 is the multiplicative identity. An "identity" in mathematics is something
      that gives you the same value back you started with. Let's look at a problem involving the
      multiplicative identity.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How would we solve this problem?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We should divide by 4 so that the x is alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. What is the answer to 4 divided by 4?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> It's 1 over 1, which is just one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. So now we have -12 divided by 4, which is -3 on the left side. And on the right
      side, 1 times x.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-5.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So the answer is -3, but we have to do something with the 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. If we use the property that one times anything is that given value, we now have -3 =
      x.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/IdentityProperties-discussion-6.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now you know how to use the additive and multiplicative identities when solving for x.
    </p>
