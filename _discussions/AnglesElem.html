      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Today we are going to learn about angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know what an angle is! It is two
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">rays</a> connected together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! Did you read that from your book?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, there are three categories of angles:
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">acute</a>,
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">obtuse</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">right</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's learn what a right angle is first. Right angles are present many places in real life.
      Look at the corners of this room or the edges of your books. A right angle is an angle that
      measures 90 degrees. A right angle looks like this:

        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The second type of angle is acute. An acute angle is an angle whose measure is between 0 and
      90 degrees. An acute angle looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let me guess! The third type is an angle whose measure is more than 90 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, an obtuse angle is an angle whose measure is between 90 and 180 degrees. An obtuse angle
      looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We also usually name angles. Look at how these lines intersect and form angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Those lines formed 8 angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job. Now, who can show me an acute angle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can! It is the one on the top right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-5.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right again. Who can show me an obtuse angle?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I think it is the one on the top left.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-6.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct. We need an easier way of referring to the angles we are talking about. So from now
      on, we will label our angles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/AnglesElem-discussion-7.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Who knows the names of the angles in this picture that are acute?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Do you just call them by the letter that we put there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, that's exactly what you do. Now what are the names of the angles that are acute?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Angles b, c, f, and g.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job, now you know the different types of angles and how we name angles. I think you're
      ready to put those ideas into practice!
    </p>
