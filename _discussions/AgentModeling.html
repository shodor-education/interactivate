      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What comes to your mind when I talk about an
      <strong>Agent Model</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know. I guess an agent could be a spy, and so the model would be like action figures
      of the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Actually, that's very close to the definition. Rather than a "special agent", though, we say
      that an agent is just any individual - a person, an animal, or even something else like a
      planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then what does it mean to have a model of that individual?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, action figures help you to visualize individuals doing various things and interacting
      with each other, so...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So then the model of the agent would just be something that represents the agent and shows
      how it moves around and does stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! An agent model is just a way for us to represent the interactions of various
      individuals, or "agents".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But how do we know what each agent does or what happens when they meet?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, think about what happens when it rains. Can you actually predict where each individual
      raindrop will land? What do you really know about raindrops as individuals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can't predict where each raindrop will land, but I do know that they are all going down and
      there are a lot of them, so anywhere that is being rained on will get wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! That is the essence of an agent model. Each individual is moving according to
      certain rules. Suppose in this example that each raindrop falls from a randomly assigned
      location within a cloud. Each raindrop continues falling until it reaches a surface, where it
      breaks and splashes. It's hard to see an overall pattern from each individual, but if we look
      at a lot of individuals together, we can predict what they will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So is that how weathermen predict rain? Surely they don't try to figure out how each raindrop
      will fall, and then count up the drops that land in a certain area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I'd imagine that would get a little tedious, for sure. Can you think of any other way that a
      weatherman could predict how much rain will fall?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Maybe he/she could look at the clouds and figure out how much water would fall from each
      cloud. Then the weatherman could just look at each cloud instead of counting millions of
      raindrops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right you are! In fact, you've just described another type of model: a
      <strong>Systems Model</strong>. Do you think you can tell me what a systems model is from the name and from your
      description?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, I guess the model involves the interaction of systems instead of agents, so instead of
      looking at each individual, we look at whole groups of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Precisely! A systems model deals with large groups of objects that interact with each other
      in certain patterns. In a lot of situations you can save yourself tons of time and energy by
      grouping objects rather than trying to predict the behavior of each and every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If a systems model is so easy to use, then why do we talk about agent models at all? Wouldn't
      it be simpler to just use systems models?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Systems models may be easier, but the problem is figuring out the rules for a systems model
      in the first place. For instance, can you create a systems model for me of rabbits, wolves,
      and grass living in a forest somewhere?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Umm...No. I know that wolves eat rabbits, and rabbits eat grass, but that's it. I have no
      idea how to actually create a model of that situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's quite understandable; I probably couldn't create a systems model off the top of my
      head either. But I bet you can create an agent model of the same situation dealing with
      individuals only.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure, the wolves would chase rabbits, the rabbits run away and eat grass, that's easy enough.
      I guess an agent model would be easier in this case since I don't know how to get started with
      a systems model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Indeed. Although systems models are easier to use, most of the time we can't come up with a
      systems model without first trying out a few agent models, just to get a concept of the way
      things work.
