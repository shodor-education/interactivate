      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Every day, the stock of Auto Superior, Inc., has 1 chance out of 3 to make a payoff. The
      stock of Books Unlimited, Inc., has 1 chance out of 5 to make payoff.
      <strong>If the stocks cost the same, which one will bring in more money over time?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> One-third is more than one-fifth, so the first stock is better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Wait! We do not have enough information to decide which stock is better. We need to know how
      large the payoffs are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Here is some additional information: if the stocks make payoffs, the stock of Auto Superior,
      Inc. (we will call it stock A for short) will pay 2 points, and stock of Books Unlimited, Inc.
      (stock B) will pay 4 points. Which one would you buy, knowing that? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Stock B is better than stock A.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> If you watch the stocks for one hundred days, how much do you
      <strong>expect</strong> them to pay per day, on the
      <strong>average</strong>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Stock A will pay on approximately one-third of all days, which means
      <strong>1/3*100</strong>. Each time, it will pay 2 points, making the total money expected
      <strong>1/3*100*2</strong>. To find the average, we have to divide by 100 (for the number of days), so the answer is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <strong>1/3*100*2/100=2/3</strong>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> We can skip multiplying by 100 and then dividing by 100, so we will get
      <strong>1/3*2=2/3</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> For stock B, we have the expected average of
      <strong>1/5*4=4/5</strong>. I have skipped the manipulations with 100.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> That's how we can always do it. To find the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">average expected payoff</a> or winning, we multiply the probability of winning by the number of points won each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Aha! We can expect stock B to pay more than stock A on the average!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you change the stocks' payoffs to make the stocks pay equally well over long periods of
      time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If we make the first one pay 30 points, and the second one 50 points, then their average
      payoffs will be the same (10 points per day).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> By the way, in mathematics the average payoff is sometimes called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">expected value</a> of payoff. Can you think of more examples where the chances of winning are different, but the
      expected values are the same? It might also be interesting to start with payoffs and find the
      probabilities of winning that will make the game fair (that is, to make the expected values of
      winning the same).
