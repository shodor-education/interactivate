      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Look at the number "0.75". What does that remind you of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It looks like seventy-five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. When a number like 0.75 is written without the dollar sign, it doesn't show money
      anymore. We call that a decimal. Have you ever heard that word before?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I've heard it when we talk about fractions, but I don't see what that number has to do with
      fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good point. Let's think about money for a moment. How many cents are in a dollar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> One hundred cents are in a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. How do you write one dollar?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> $1.00
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. The 1 represents the number of dollars, but why do we write the two zeroes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They show how many cents there are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Try to tell me two things that the word quarter makes you think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Money and fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. We write one quarter of a dollar as "$0.25". That's in money form, but it's almost
      the same in fractions and decimals. 1/4 of 1 whole is 0.25 in decimal form.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Where did the 25 come from? I understand in money because a quarter is 25 cents, but 25 has
      nothing to do with 1/4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's a really good point, but the 25 actually does have something to do with 1/4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How? None of those numbers are the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why do you think we call the coins that are worth 25 cents "quarters"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because 25 cents is one-quarter of a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you write one quarter as a fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, I get it. It's 1/4. 25 cents is 1/4 of a dollar. A dollar is 100 cents, so 25 is 1/4 of
      100.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. Decimals just take a fraction use place value to express it. Since there are two
      places, this decimal is like saying, "what is this fraction of one hundred?" So the decimal
      form of 1/4 is 0.25. What would be the decimal form of 1/100?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That's easy! 0.01
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're exactly right. Now I think you're ready to convert more difficult fractions into
      decimals.
    </p>
