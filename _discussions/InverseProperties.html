      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We have talked about the basics of solving linear equations by getting the "x" by itself on
      one side of the equals sign, but we need to learn some terminology related to solving
      equations. How would you begin this problem?
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Since we want the x to be alone, I would divide both sides by 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. Can anyone think of a number that you could
      <em>multiply</em> both sides by and still have the x be alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> What? You want to multiply something by 8 and then get 1? Doesn't multiplying always make a
      number bigger?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Does it have to be a whole number or integer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, it doesn't. What are you thinking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, isn't multiplying by 1/8 the same thing as dividing by 8?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. 1/8 has a special name in this problem, it is the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">multiplicative inverse</a>. What do you think of when you hear the word "inverse"?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. The multiplicative inverse is a special kind of "opposite." A number multiplied by
      its multiplicative inverse will always result in a product of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> And 8 multiplied by 1/8 is one!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. So when we divide by 8 or multiply by 1/8 in this problem, we are using the
      multiplicative inverse property.

    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Remember that each number will have a unique multiplicative inverse and different numbers
      will have different multiplicative inverses. What is the multiplicative inverse of -2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> A number that when multiplied by -2 equals 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yeah, but isn't that number -1/2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> What about the problems where one side is "x plus a number"? Are you using the multiplicative
      inverse?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We aren't using the multiplicative inverse, but we are using the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">additive inverse</a> in that type of problem. Can you make a hypothesis about the definition of an "additive
      inverse"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Since a number times its multiplicative inverse is always one, maybe it is a number that when
      added to another number equals one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do we want our sums to equal one? Do you want to reduce a problem to 8 = x + 1?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Oh no. We want it to be zero. So it is the number that you add to get 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, the sum of a number and its additive inverse is always 0. Remember that an additive
      inverse for one number is unique to that number, so different numbers will have different
      additive inverses. What is the additive inverse in this problem?
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Negative five because 5 plus -5 equals 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. What is the additive inverse of -3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, I think you just change the sign, so it must be 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Excellent. When you add or subtract a number to get zero you are using the additive inverse.
      Always remember that the additive and multiplicative inverses are specific to the problem that
      you are working on.
