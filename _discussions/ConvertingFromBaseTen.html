      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know how to convert numbers from base ten to base two, but are there other bases that I
      need to learn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, there are, but you've already learned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How is that possible? We've only talked about base ten and base two.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But the same rules apply for all of the other number bases. Let's try one and see: 18 in base
      ten is what in base 5?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, 15 ones is the same as 3 fives, right? That leaves 3 ones left. So it should be 33. Is
      that right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, it is. See? You can do it. Now do you think you can take a number in base five and
      convert it to base ten?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's try. What about the number 521. Let's convert that from base five to base ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I don't think we can do that. The number 521 doesn't exist in base five. Think about it and
      see if you can explain why.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I guess the 5 isn't right. In base two, 2 was written as 10. In base five, I guess 5 should
      be written as 10, too. But why do we call it base five if there aren't any fives?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question. Think about how 5 is special in base five. Don't think about the number.
      Instead, picture five objects. What's special about a group that is that big?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, when there are 5...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, we're not saying "5" anymore. That number doesn't exist in this base.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When there are that many cubes, we put them together to make a stick, and we write it 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. In base five, 5 is the number that makes up the next place value. In base ten, it's
      really easy to add and subtract with 10, isn't it? Do you think that is the case in base five?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, 5 is a lot harder to add and subtract with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> But it's not 5 anymore, remember? Try to add this 1 stick of five cubes to 2 more cubes. How
      do you write that number in base five?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the 1 stick plus 2 cubes is written "12". Oh, I get it! You add just like you do in
      base ten, only the numbers stand for different amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why do you think that is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When you're adding, you don't actually need to count the cubes on the stick. You just need to
      count the stick. So 1 stick (even if it has only 5 cubes) and 2 cubes is 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly right! Now keep that in mind when you're working with other numbers and bases. When
      you change bases, all you're really changing is how long each stick is.
