      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So now that I understand addition and subtraction, are there more operations?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes there are. The next operation is called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">multiplication</a>. We write multiplication problems in the form a x b, or a times b. For an example we will
      consider 5 x 3. What this means is that 5 is being added to itself 3 times (5 + 5 + 5), but a
      better way to think about is that it means 5 groups of 3 units each. Therefore, to solve 5 x 3
      you would count the number of units in each group.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I feel a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Alright, we will use an example you can visualize. Picture 5 separate plates, each with 3
      quarters on them. How many quarters are there all together?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, if there are 3 quarters for each of the 5 plates, then there are 15 quarters all
      together. So 5 x 3 = 15.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. Now, what if we had 3 plates, each with 5 quarters?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then there would be 5 quarters for each of the 3 plates, meaning 15 quarters altogether. So 3
      x 5 = 15. Does that mean that multiplication is commutative like addition?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, multiplication is commutative. For any a and b, a x b = b x a. It is also associative.
      If you are multiplying three numbers, then (a x b) x c = a x (b x c). Now, what do you think
      would happen in the case where a number was multiplied by 0 or 1? If you have trouble just try
      to visualize what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hmm, if you had any number of plates p, each with 0 quarters, you would have 0 quarters
      altogether. So any number times 0 equals 0. Now, if you had 1 plate with q quarters, then
      there would be q quarters altogether. So any number times 1 is just the number itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is absolutely right. You thought through that very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> This isn't so hard, but what about negative numbers? I know how to add them, but how do you
      multiply negative numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, first I should explain a little more about what a negative number is. Even though the
      negative numbers are less than zero, this does not mean that they are less than nothing. A
      negative number is merely a negation of a positive number. For instance, what would happen if
      you traveled one mile east and then backtracked one mile west?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You would end up where you started.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, the one mile you traveled west negated the mile you traveled east. Another way to
      express your movement west would be to say you traveled -(one mile east), or negative one mile
      east. So we can think of the negative sign as an operator, just as the multiplication sign is
      an operator. Its operation would be to replace positive units with negative units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Where exactly is this all leading us?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Precisely where we want to be. Remember that a positive unit plus a negative unit always
      equals zero, thus, the positive and negative of a number have an inverse relationship. This
      means that the negative of a positive is a negative and that the negative of a negative is a
      positive. Knowing this, we can now move on to multiplication by negative numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based off the definition I gave you earlier, what do you think 2 x (-3) equals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, 2 x (-3) would be 2 groups, each with (-3) units, so that would be (-6) units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, that one was tricky, but mostly straightforward. How about this one: What is (-2) x 3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That would be (-2) groups, each with 3 units. How do you count negative groups, though?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> First, let me rephrase it as negative 2 groups, each with 3 units. Now, a negative group is
      merely a group that would negate a positive group. What kind of group would negate a group of
      3 units?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A group of 3 units would be negated by a group of (-3) units, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, therefore (-2) x 3 = 2 x (-3), which we already know is equal to (-6) units. Now what do
      you think (-2) x (-3) equals?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, that would be negative 2 groups, each with 3 negative units. So I need to know what
      kind of group would negate a group of 3 negative units . . . a group of 3 positive units! So
      (-2) x (-3) = 2 x 3 = 6. I think that's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's exactly right. So what you can see from these few examples is that a negative number
      times a positive number will give you a negative number and a negative number times a negative
      number will give you a positive number.
