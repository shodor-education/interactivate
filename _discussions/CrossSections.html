    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> If you cut a slice of a cube, what shape cut is created?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A square!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Is that always true? What if you cut the cube at an angle?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, then two of the sides would be longer than the other two, so I guess the shape would be a
    rectangle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. Now what would happen if you cut the cube at a different angle - say, if you just
    cut off the very tip of the cube?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then...I guess it would be a triangle, like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/CrossSections-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! What other shapes do you think could be created by cutting a cross section of a
    square?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hmm, well I bet that if you can create a triangle by cutting off just a corner of the cube,
    then you can create a pentagon by cutting off a bigger chunk, like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/CrossSections-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's good, so you see that you can create a cross section with more sides than the original
    shape. What would happen if you angled the cross section even more, so that the top corner of
    the cross section was cut off as well?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Then you would have...a hexagon!
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/CrossSections-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! Do you think you can contruct a figure with more sides, such as a heptagon?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can't figure out how to do that, since I can't seem to cut off more than two of the four
    corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Don't worry, what I asked you to do is actually impossible! There are only six faces on a cube,
    so the highest number of sides possible is six.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That makes sense. I bet you can do that with any prism - it's just a matter of angling the
    cross section correctly to intersect all of the faces.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're very right, any prism can be cut in such a way that the cross section has as many sides
    as the prism has faces. However, not all shapes have this same property. Can you think of a
    3-dimensional figure whose sides
    <em>cannot</em> all be sliced through by the same plane?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Perhaps an Icosahedron, because there is no plane that can intersect all twenty of its sides:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/CrossSections-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" which="medium" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, the Icosahedron is an example of a polyhedron that is not a prism. If we consider prisms
    only, what would happen to the cross sections of a prism if the number of lateral faces
    approached infinity?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I've never heard of an infinity-sided prism...
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, when you are trying to visualize something you haven't seen before, try building off of
    what you already know. Imagine a regular square, then a regular pentagon, then a regular
    hexagon, and so on. As the number of sides gets larger, what other shape does the figure
    approach?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Hmm, it's starting to look more like a circle because you can't see any of the individual
    sides.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. In fact, mathematicians formally define a circle as a regular polygon with an infinite
    number of sides. So what would happen if you sliced into a circular prism, also known as a
    cylinder?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, obviously you could make a circle if you cut the figure horizontally, and you could make
    a rectangle if you cut the figure vertically. More interesting, though, is the fact that you can
    make an oval if you cut a cylinder through at an angle:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/CrossSections-discussion-5.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are an infinite number of three-dimensional shapes, each one with its own cross section.
    In fact, every two-dimensional shape can be defined as a cross section of a three-dimensional
    shape. This will come in handy when you discuss Conic Sections, but it will also be useful if
    you decide to take Multivariable Calculus and other high-level math classes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why define two-dimensional shapes as cross sections? Why not just leave them in two dimensions?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> When dealing with two-dimensional shapes, usually it
    <em>is</em> simpler to just leave them in two dimensions. A big use of cross sections, though, is to
    calculate the volume of irregular figures. When you take Calculus, you will learn how to
    calculate the area of almost any two-dimensional shape. Since a three-dimensional object can be
    divided into a large number of cross-sections, the areas of those cross-sections can be used to
    calculate the volume of the three-dimensional object.
