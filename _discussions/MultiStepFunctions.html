      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So now I know all about building functions with variables! This isn't so bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, what you have actually learned so far is what a simple, one-step function is like. This
      is just a small part of a bigger picture. The next type of function we should look at is a
      multi-step function. Do you think you can give me an example of a multi-step function?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let me think. What about taking a number, adding 1 to it and then multiplying by 3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Now how would you write that using the variables x and y?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <span class="mentor">Student:</span>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
        x + 1 * 3 = y ?
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sort of. We need to be a little careful here, so that the person using the function knows to
      add first and then multiply. Mathematicians realized a long time ago (in the fifteenth century
      as algebra was being used more and more) that there needed to be rules about how to write
      anything with more than one operation so there would be no ambiguity. A standard evolved for
      the order of operations, which we still follow today:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Do all parentheses first
        </li>
        <li>
          All exponents next
        </li>
        <li>
          Then comes multiplication and division from left to right
        </li>
        <li>
          Save all additions and subtractions for last and compute those left to right
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So for clarity I need to write it as
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
          y = (x + 1) * 3
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. You can also write the same equation these other ways:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
            y = 3 * (x + 1)
          </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
            y = 3(x + 1)
          </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
            y = 3 * x + 3
          </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
            y = 3x + 3
          </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, each one gives the same output using 3 as an input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's true, but we have seen functions that are different for some numbers and the same for
      others. For example, y = x + 6 and y = 3 * x both give 9 as an output when 3 is the input. Can
      you explain it another way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, for the functions you just named, the output is only the same for the input 3, where
      the functions you gave earlier are the same for
      <em>any</em> input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good observation. So they are all the same because they are rearrangements that follow
      arithmetic properties. These properties say:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We can multiply or add two numbers in any order. This is the commutative property.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can distribute multiplication across addition. This is the distributive property.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So the same function can have different forms?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly - and when we allow more complicated things, like many more than just one or two
      operations, and include exponentiation in the list, checking that two functions are equivalent
      becomes more challenging.
