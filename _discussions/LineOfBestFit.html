      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why does the line of best fit not always touch as many points as possible on a scatter plot?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A line of best fit is often useful to attempt to represent data with the equation of a
      straight line in order to predict values that may not be displayed on the plot. The line of
      best fit is determined by the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">correlation</a> between the two variables on a scatter plot. In the case that there are a few outliers (data
      points that are located far away from the rest of the data) the line will adjust so that it
      represents those points as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But why does it need to include outliers if most of the data is in one area of the scatter
      plot?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A line of best fit represents ALL of the data in a scatter plot so it must include the
      outliers in order to be an accurate representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, how do I know where to draw the line of best fit when the data includes outliers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is not too hard to make a close guess if you take some time to look at the data. We can
      try doing that with a problem right now. We can use the activity
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Regression' | relative_url }}">Regression</a> to help visualize it. First, plot (1,2) (2,3) and (3,4). How do you think the line of best
      fit for this data will look?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The line of best fit will touch all of those points because those points make a straight
      line. The line will go upwards and it will be pretty steep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right. We can take a look at the line by selecting the button
      <em> Display line of best fit </em>. The line of best fit crosses through all of the data points just like you said. However, if
      you add the point (9,3) what do you think will happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think that the line will adjust so that it will be less steep. It will not touch all of the
      data points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, you can deselect
      <em> Display line of best fit </em>, plot the outlier, and then select
      <em> Fit your own line </em> so you can show me what you are thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I think it would look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/LineOfBestFit-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now you can check how close your guess is by selecting
      <em> Display line of best fit </em>. That is very close! You can compare the equations to see how close you were as well. The
      equation for your estimated line of best fit is in green and the equation for the true line of
      best fit is in red. This program could be fun to use to experiment with what could happen with
      outliers in different places on the scatter plot or by plotting more dots in one area.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Cool! Now I understand how to draw lines of best fit more accurately and I know what to keep
      in mind when there is an outlier.
    </p>
