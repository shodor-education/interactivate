  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: What is the distributive property?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Well, the distributive property states that the product of the sum or difference of two
    numbers is the same as the sum or difference of their products. For example, 2*(5-3) is the same
    value as 2*5 - 2*3. The distributive property is used if there is a number (or variable) that
    needs to be multiplied by an addition or subtraction problem in parenthesis.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: I don't see how 2(5-3) and 2*5 - 2*3 can be the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Let's first use the distributive property to solve this problem by finding the difference of
    their products. That means that we will do what?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: The 2 outside of the parenthesis needs to be multiplied by the numbers 5 and 3 in the
    parenthesis?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Yes, so the distributive property tells us to multiply the two by each of the numbers and keep
    the sign that is between the numbers. Therefore, you would first multiply 2 by 5 and what would
    your answer be?
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-1.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: 2*5=10.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Then you would keep the minus sign and put it after the 10. So that it would look like this:
    10 - __. Next, you would multiply the 2 by the 3 and what would your answer be?
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-2.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: 2*3 = 6.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Correct, so your answer for 2*5 - 2*3 would be: 10 - 6. Now you can do simple subtraction and
    what do you get?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span> 10-6 = 4. So the answer is four.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Let's see if that is the same answer as if we did the subtraction within the parenthesis and
    then multiplied it by the number outside of the parenthesis so that we are finding the product
    of the difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    2(5-3) => 2(2) = 4.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: They are the same! Either way that we solve the problem, whether we find the product of the
    difference of two numbers in parenthesis or the difference of their products, we get the same
    answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Exactly. Now let's try using a variable and applying the distributive property. Here is a
    problem to solve:
  </p>
  <p>
    -4 + x(3 - x) = ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: I would first use the distributive property so I multiply "x" by 3. This would give me 3x.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-3.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, I would write down the minus sign after the "x" and then multiply the "x" by the "x" in
    the parenthesis and that would be x^2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-4.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Great, so what would the difference of their products be?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: 3x - x^2. Then I have to make sure to include the -4 at the beginning of the problem so the
    final solution would be: -4+3x-x^2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Good! Now let's try solving for "x" using the distributive property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solve for "x" in this problem: 4= -5(x + (-2))
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: Well first I will do the distributive property so I would start at the beginning of the
    parenthesis and multiply (-5) by "x" which would be (-5x).
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-5.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, I would write the addition sign that is in the parenthesis between the two values. Then, I
    will multiply the (-5) by (-2) which is 10!
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-6.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: So what have you solved so far?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: 4 = (-5x) + 10
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Now you can solve for "x".
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="student">Student</span>: Right, so I want to get "x" on a side by itself. To do this I will subtract 10 from both sides
    and the problem will look like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    4 - 10 = (-5x) + 10 - 10 => 4-10 = (-5x)
  </p>
  <p>
    Then I will solve 4-10 and that is -6. Now my problem is:
  </p>
  <p>
    -6 = (-5x)
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I have to get x by itself so I need to divide both sides by (-5) so I have "x" on one side.
    The solution then is:
  </p>
  <p>
    6/5 = x
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Good work! You used the distributive property to solve for "x". Let's check your work: The
    original problem was 4= -5(x + (-2)) so I will replace "x" with (6/5) since that is the number
    that you found it to represent.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/DistributiveProperty-discussion-7.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Here I will use the distributive property and solve to get: 4 = -6 + (10). Now I will do simple
    addition: 4 = 4. Good work, you found the correct value for "x"!
  </p>
