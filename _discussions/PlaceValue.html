      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Do you remember using "ten-sticks" or "base ten blocks" in kindergarten?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, but I thought we were talking about place value. What do ten-sticks have to do with
      place value?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Ten-sticks actually have a lot to do with place value. Let's look at an example. What does
      the 2 in the number 23 represent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It represents twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. And what would it look like if we used ten-sticks, or base 10 blocks, to make a
      representation of this number?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It would have two sticks of ten and 3 individual cubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. We could also think of it as 2 tens and 3 ones, couldn't we? Are you starting to see
      how this connects to place value?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, but we don't use ten-sticks anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, now we try to keep all of that information in our head. We write numbers in expanded
      form instead of building them with base ten blocks. Do you remember what that means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's when you write 20 + 3 to show 23.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. That helps us see each number's place value. Look at the 2. It's not just a 2, is
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No, it's 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because it comes before the 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It does come before the three, but the most important thing about it that tells us that it's
      actually 20 and not 2 is that it's in the tens place. That means that we can put any number in
      the second place like we did with the 2, and it means 2 tens instead of 2 ones. Think about a
      different example. What does the 5 mean in the number 523?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It means 500.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Because the 5 is in the hundreds spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly. That's what people are talking about when they say "place value". Do you think you
      understand now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. You can move a number to a different place and it stands for tens, hundreds, or even
      thousands, right?
    </p>
