      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In the Three Boxes game, each box contains two chips: the first has two red chips, the second
      has two green chips, and the third has one red and one green chip. We do not know which box
      contains which chips. We take one chip out of a box without looking inside, and when we look
      at it we find it is green. What are the chances, theoretically speaking, that the second one
      is also green?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> There is only one box out of three that has two green chips, so the probability should be
      <strong>1/3</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> We know that the first chip was green. There are only two boxes holding green chips. One of
      them has two green chips, so the probability is
      <strong>1/2</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> But wait, we have played the game on the computer many times. The experimental probability
      was getting closer and closer to
      <strong>2/3</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We have three competing answers! It means that the problem is not very simple. Let us look at
      several easier problems and then return to The Three Boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us look at a dice game with two six-sided dice. The sum of the dice decides who wins (see
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/TablesAndCombinatori' | relative_url }}">Multi-dice fun</a> for a detailed discussion of the game, or the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/DiceTable' | relative_url }}">activity page (Game 4)</a> to play a related game). What is the probability that the sum of the numbers on the dice is
      seven?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are six ways of getting the sum of seven:
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        1, 6
      </p>
      <p>
        2, 5
      </p>
      <p>
        3, 4
      </p>
      <p>
        4, 3
      </p>
      <p>
        5, 2
      </p>
      <p>
        6, 1
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      There are 36 possible ways two dice can roll, so the probability of the sum of seven is 6 out
      of 36, or 1/6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us call:
    </p>
    <p>
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            Event A={The sum of the numbers the dice show is 7 or 9}.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Event B={The second die shows 2 or 3}.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us compute P(A) and P(B) (the probabilities of Events A and B) using the most
      straightforward method: counting chances. That is, we can count the favorable situations and
      find the total number of outcomes. The following table lists the outcomes and sums of the dice
      in case of each outcome:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConditionalProb-discussion-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      We can highlight the places in the table that correspond to all the outcomes in Event A and
      Event B:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <link name="table">
          <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConditionalProb-discussion-2.gif' | relative_url }}" />
        </a>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            Event A={The sum of the numbers the dice show is 7 or 9}.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Event B={The second die shows 2 or 3}.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is P(A) (the probability of Event A)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are 10 outcomes in Event A out of 36 total outcomes, so P(A) = 10/36 = 5/18.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is the probability of getting a sum of 7 or 9, when we know that the second die has
      rolled a 2 or 3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Why is it not the same as P(A)?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Because not all of the 36 outcomes are possible now. Even some of the outcomes that give the
      sum of 7 or 9 are impossible. We have to count the outcomes all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Mathematicians would say that our question is about
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">conditional probability</a>, because it asks: "What is the probability of Event A on
      <strong>condition</strong> of Event B? That is the same thing as "in the case of Event B." There even exists a special
      sign for just that kind of probability (when people invent something new, they often invent
      notation to go with it;
      <strong>you</strong> can make up your own notation when you invent something). Recall that instead of writing "the
      probability of Event A" we can simply write P(A). Well, instead of writing: "
      <strong>The probability of Event A on condition of Event B</strong>" people write:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>P(A/B)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It's much shorter!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> To compute P(A/B), we can go through the same procedure. In order to have the sum of 7 or 9
      if the second die rolls a 2 or 3, we must have the following pairs of numbers on the dice (see
      the
      <link href="#table">table</a>):
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        5, 2
      </p>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <p>
        4, 3
      </p>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <p>
        6, 3
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      That makes 3 outcomes. Out of what total number of
      <strong>possible</strong> outcomes? We now know for sure that Event B={The second die shows 2 or 3} happened. It means
      that the outcomes that are
      <strong>not</strong> in Event B are
      <strong>not possible</strong>. So, how many outcomes do we count as possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Only the outcomes in Event B. There are 12 of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> So the conditional probability is:
    </p>
    <p>
      P(A/B) = 3/12 = 1/4 = .25 or 25%
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I want to show you something. What is the probability that Events A and B happen at the same
      time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are 3 outcomes out of 36 in this case, so we have P(A and B) = 3/36 = 1/12
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> To summarize,
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        P(A/B) = 1/4
      </p>
      <p>
        P(A and B) = 1/12
      </p>
      <p>
        P(B) = 1/3
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have 1/4 = (1/12) / (1/3)
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In other words, if we divide the probability of A and B happening at the same time by the
      probability of B, we get the conditional probability P(A/B). In the language of formulas, it
      means:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>P(A/B) = P(A and B)/P(B)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a coincidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If it were, you would not be asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I could be, just for the fun of it... Anyway, why do you think it is not a coincidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> How were we computing P(A/B)? First of all, we took the number of outcomes that were in A and
      B at the same time. Then we divided it by the number of outcomes in B:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConditionalProb-discussion-3.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> It looks much like your formula for conditional probability, only we have the numbers of
      outcomes instead of probabilities. Can we turn them into probabilities somehow?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you get the probability of an event if you know the number of outcomes in the event?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I figure out the total number of all possible outcomes and divide by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You know, it does not change the fraction if you divide both the numerator and the
      denominator by the same number...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know! If we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the outcome formula by the
      total number of outcomes, we will get the probability formula:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/discussions/ConditionalProb-discussion-4.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      which is the same as:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <strong>
          <link name="formula">P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</a>
        </strong>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us try other examples to see if this conditional probability rule always works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> I will call
    </p>
    <p>
      Event K = {The first die rolls 5 or 6} and
    </p>
    <p>
      Event L = {The second die rolls 1}
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the probability of K on condition of L?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> It is 2/6 = 1/3. Looking at the
      <link href="#table">table</a>, I see that there are 2 outcomes in K that can happen if L happens: (5, 1) and (6, 1). The
      total number of possible outcomes is 6, all the outcomes in L.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The
      <link href="#formula">formula</a> also works, because:
    </p>
    <p>
      P(K/L) = P(K and L) / P(L) = (2/36) / (6/36) = 1/3
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> By the way, if you remember the discussion and the formula for two independent events
      happening simultaneously, you can use it to find P(K and L).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The formula is:
    </p>
    <p>
      P(K and L) = P(K) * P(L),
    </p>
    <p>
      so P(K and L) = 2/6 * 1/6 = 2/36
    </p>
    <p>
      The same number we got by counting the outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us now look at The Three Boxes Game. Do you think you can solve the mystery now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The Three Boxes Game is all about conditional probability. The question is: "What is the
      probability that the second chip in the box is green, given that the first one is green?" We
      can use the formula to solve it. Let us call:
    </p>
    <p>
      Event A = {the second chip in the box is green}
    </p>
    <p>
      Event B = {the first chip in the box is green}
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we are looking for P(A/B), and we can use the formula P(A/B) = P (A and B) / P(B).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> P(A and B) = 1/3, because there is one box out of three where both chips are green.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> P(B) = 3/6 = 1/2, because there are three green chips out of six total.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Then the formula gives us:
    </p>
    <p>
      P(A/B) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Ta-da! We got the same number in the experiments.
    </p>
