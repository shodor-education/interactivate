description: "APC.06 The student will investigate the derivative at a point on a curve. This will include finding the slope of a curve at a point, including points at which the tangent is vertical and points at which there are no tangents; using local linear approximation to find the slope of a tangent line to a curve at the point; defining instantaneous rate of change as the limit of average rate of change; and, approximating rate of change from graphs and tables of values."
