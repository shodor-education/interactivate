      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So, a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">set</a> is like a group of numbers that are the same type of thing, or, I mean, they have something
      in common?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right! Do you know what an
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">element</a> is, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, it is one of the numbers in a set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's very good. Can anyone think of an example of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Is 5 an element of the set of odd numbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great example! Can someone name an element of the set of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">prime numbers</a>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> I think 13 is an element of the set of prime numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You learn very fast! Can anyone think of an element of the set of perfect squares? Round
      fruit? Flavors of ice cream? Members of this class?
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue questioning students until they see what it means to have a set and to be an element
      of a set.
