      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What relationships can there be between two different variables in bivariate data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, there can be positive relationships, negative (or inverse) relationships and then there
      are variables that have no relationship with one another. A positive relationship would exist
      if as one variable increases, the other variable increases or, if as one variable decreases,
      the other variable decreases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I'm not quite sure I understand how both of those situations are positive relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> An example of a positive relationship would be between the two variables temperature and
      population at the beach. It is commonly known that as the weather gets warmer more people go
      to the beach, right? This means that as the temperature increases the amount of people at the
      beach will increase. This also means that as the temperature decreases there are fewer people
      at the beach. Despite the fact that the relationship was worded differently, the graph will
      still look the same for both and it is representing the same situation. Both of these
      situations are positive relationships because as one variable either decreases or increases
      the other variable does the same. Now, can you give me an example of what you would imagine a
      negative relationship to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, now that I know what makes a relationship positive I can make a guess based off of
      that. I think two variables would have a negative relationship if when one variable either
      decreases or increases the other variable does the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right! Can you think an example?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um, the more I go jogging the less time it will take me to run a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! Often as the amount of time you exercise increases, the less time it takes to run a
      mile. What are the two variables?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How long it takes me to run a mile would be one variable, and how often I jog would be the
      other variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good! Now, since bivariate data focuses on a relationship between two variables there
      often will be one variable that is assumed to be the variable that is in control of the other
      variable. In the example you provided how much you jog controls the amount of time it takes
      you to run a mile. Therefore, how long it takes you to run a mile is dependent on how much you
      go jogging. There are names for both of these variables: one is an independent variable (in
      this case this would be the amount of time you spend jogging) and one is the dependent
      variable (in this case it would be how long it takes you to run a mile). Now what do you think
      would be the independent and dependent variable for the beach example I gave earlier?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the warmer it gets the more people that go to the beach. So, the temperature controls
      the population and the amount of people that go is dependent on how warm it is at the beach.
      This means that the temperature is the independent variable and the population at the beach is
      the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! You can use the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Regression' | relative_url }}">Regression</a> activity to plot and view the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in
      a situation. The independent variable should be along the x-axis and the dependent variable
      should be along the y-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Cool, I now know how to determine whether a bivariate data set represents a positive or
      negative correlation. I can even determine which variables in a bivariate data set are
      independent and which are dependent.
