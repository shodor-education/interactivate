<p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> When we talk about multiples of whole numbers, do we just mean the times tables?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Sort of. Let's use an example to get this idea straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the number 3; what are the multiples of 3? The formal definition of a multiple of 3
      is: any number that three divides evenly or any number for which 3 is a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">factor</a>. For a number to be divided "evenly" by three the answer must be a whole number with no
      remainders. So, 27 is a multiple of 3 since 27 / 3 = 9 (9 is a whole number), but 25 is not
      since 25 / 3 = 8 + a remainder of 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So anything in the 3 times table is going to be a multiple of 3. Are there other multiples of
      3?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What do you think? Can I have a number that is not in the 3 times table that has 3 as a
      factor?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> To have three as a factor, the number has to be equal to 3 times something, so I think all of
      the multiples of 3 are in the three times table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Can you list part of the three times table?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <pre>

 	  is      0   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36  39  42  45
