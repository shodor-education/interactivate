      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> We are going to study
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">functions</a> by using a model. This particular model closely resembles the way scientists think about
      functions. Let me draw a machine, which can be anything with two openings. Arrows show "In"
      and "Out" directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image93.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What are the
      <strong>X</strong> and
      <strong>Y</strong> for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span>
      <strong>X</strong> and
      <strong>Y</strong> are traditional names for
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">input</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">output</a>, that is, for the numbers that we
      <strong>put into</strong> the machine and the number that the machines
      <strong>puts out</strong>. A number goes in, the machine does something to it, and another number comes out. The
      function machine does the same thing to every number. Sometimes we just call it "function" for
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how the machine works: the directions are written in a special code people use for
      functions. Let's use this special code for an example: X + 2 = Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So, what is your number?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> (points to the equation) The function machine does something to 5, and out comes 7.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 12.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In comes 12, out comes 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It adds 2!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You have revealed the secret of this function. See if you can read the mathematical language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure, X plus 2 is equal to Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Here is another machine. Try to find out what this one does! Give me some numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In comes 3, out goes 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It adds 3!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Try another number just to check.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> In comes 10, out goes 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> (puzzled) 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Aha! I know this one. It is multiplying by 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you make a machine that describes something from your life?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How about one about a price increase. If every price was raised 10%, the machine gives you
      what you pay extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would like to construct the next machine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you think of some other function machines?
    </p>
