    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have figured out how to read simple graphs, and I hope it will help me to learn how to make
      new graphs from old.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have seen people looking at a graph of distance vs. time, for example, and sketching the
      graph of velocity vs. time for the same movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us try to do it for the graph we used
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/GatheringInformation' | relative_url }}">before</a> :

    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image15.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can already see how to make velocity graph for the straight line parts, because they
      describe movement with constant velocity. For the first two seconds, the person moved with
      velocity of 1/2 meter per second; during the fifth second, with velocity of -4 meters per
      second (it is negative because the distance from zero was decreasing); and for the last three
      seconds, the person did not move at all, so the velocity was zero. I can sketch that:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image77.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But what about the time between two and four seconds from the start? I see that the person
      was moving quite fast at the beginning of that time, but slowed down more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You can use approximations. You can divide this time period into several "pieces" and pretend
      that velocity did not change during each of them. This is one of the most common methods of
      calculus. The more pieces, or
      <strong>intervals</strong>, you have...
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The better I will approximate the real situation. Let me do half-second intervals. From 2 to
      2.5 seconds, the person covered about 1.5 meters... Wait, I better make a table:

      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You can already make an approximate graph of velocity for the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Student draws:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image78.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I would like to point something out. Do you think it is possible or not to change velocity
      instantly, as our graph suggests?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I do not think so. It takes time to change velocity. You can't go from .5 meters per second
      to 3 meters per second in no time, as our graph suggests. In real life, you will have to
      accelerate from one velocity to another, even if you do it very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I suggest we smooth the graph out a little to make it more realistic, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image79.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Now we did it! We made velocity graph out of distance graph!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us now take this graph and build a graph of acceleration by it. Remember, acceleration is
      change in velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So if velocity does not change, acceleration is zero. When velocity increases, acceleration
      is positive, and when velocity decreases, acceleration is negative. In our velocity graph, in
      the period from 2 to 4 seconds velocity decreases fast at first and then slower and slower. By
      the end of this period, velocity stays almost the same. So acceleration will go from some
      negative number to almost zero, for time from 2 to 4 seconds. The places where we smoothed the
      velocity graph out mean very fast changes in velocity, that is, large numbers for
      acceleration. My graph looks strange:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image80.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> This only happens because the original movement is strange. By the way, is it realistic that
      acceleration changes instantly?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Not really, so we may need to smooth out the acceleration graph. It is interesting that in
      every place where the distance graph is a straight line, the acceleration is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It makes sense, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Of course it does: if the distance vs. time graph is a straight line, then velocity is
      constant. Constant velocity means zero acceleration.
    </p>
