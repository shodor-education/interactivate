      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I just flipped a coin several times and the coin landed on heads more than tails. I had 9
      heads and only 6 tails. I don't understand why that happened since heads and tails should be
      equally likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How do you know that landing on heads is just as likely as landing on tails when a coin is
      tossed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, a coin only has two sides (heads and tails) so that means that flipping a coin can have
      two possible
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/o' | relative_url }}">outcomes</a>. The chances for both are equal since the coin is essentially the same on both sides.
      Therefore, the chances of a coin landing on heads would be 1/2, and the chances of it landing
      on tails would also be 1/2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right! What you just found was the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}"> theoretical probability</a> of a coin landing on heads (1/2 or 50%) and a coin landing on tails (1/2 or 50%).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Alright, well why aren't my results from flipping a coin just now the same as the theoretical
      probability of flipping a coin?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Theoretical probability is a way of estimating what could happen based on the information
      that you have; it is a calculation. Theoretical probability cannot predict what the actual
      results will be, but it does give you an idea of what is likely to happen in a situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I understand that. So the results of flipping a coin should be somewhere around 50% heads and
      50% tails since that is the theoretical probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! Now let's look at the coin flipping game that you just played. What were the results?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The coin landed on heads 9 times and on tails 6 times. That means I flipped the coin 15
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> OK, we are going to use this information to find another form of probability called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">experimental probability</a>. To find the experimental probability, you find the ratio of the number of trials with a
      certain outcome to total number of trials. Experimental probability of winning= # of trials
      with a certain outcome/# of total trials. So let's first find the experimental probability of
      flipping heads. For this situation the number of games won would be the number of flips that
      landed on heads. That would be 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The number of games played was 15, so that means that the experimental probability is 9/15
      (or simplified, 3/5)!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now what would the experimental probability of flipping tails be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the number of games won in this situation would be the number of times that I flipped
      tails, so 6. Then, I played 15 games so the ratio would be 6/15 (or simplified, 2/5).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great. Now, can you write these experimental probabilities as percents?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I would multiply 3/5 by 100% and get 60% as the experimental probability of flipping heads.
      Then for tails I would multiply 2/5 by 100% and get 40%. The experimental probability of
      flipping tails is 40%.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The experimental probabilities were 40% tails and 60% heads. This does not precisely match
      with the theoretical probability of 50% tails and 50% heads. However, they are not too far
      off. Let's do an experiment! Using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Coin' | relative_url }}">coin toss activity</a>, toss the coin 25 times and then 150 times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, after 25 tosses I got 11 heads and 14 tails, and after 150 tosses I got 71 heads and 79
      tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Alright, we know the theoretical probability will be 50% heads and 50% tails no matter how
      many trials, but what would the experimental probability be in this experiment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For 25 tosses the probability of heads would be 11/25 (44%) and for tails would be 14/25
      (56%). For 125 tosses the probability of heads would be 71/150 (about 47%) and the probability
      of tails would be 79/150 (about 53%).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now which results have the experimental probability closer to the theoretical probability?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> After 25 tosses, the experimental probabilities of heads and tails are not very close to 50%.
      However, after 150 tosses the experimental probabilities for heads and tails are much closer
      to 50%.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you make an educated guess at what that means?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it seems that with more tosses, the resulting experimental probabilities are closer to
      the theoretical probabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! As the amount of trials (in this case a trial is flipping a coin) increases, the
      experimental probability gets closer to the theoretical probability. You can test this concept
      with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/CrazyChoicesGame' | relative_url }}">Crazy Choices Game</a>.
