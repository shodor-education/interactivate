      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Is there a way to calculate the perimeter of these random shapes without having to count
      everything?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes there is, let's look at an example. The first step is to "box" the object in. Then count
      the length and width of "the box."
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image195.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the length is 4 and the width is 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now, lets find the perimeter of "the box." Perimeter is the distance around "the box," which
      is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image197.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> For this example the perimeter is two times four plus two times five.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes it is. Now remember that me must multiply first and then add according to the order of
      operations. So the perimeter of "the box" is eight plus ten, which equals eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Now we know what the perimeter of "the box" is, but what does that have to do with the
      perimeter of the object?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> They are the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> No way they are the same. That doesn't make any sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It makes sense if you look at the picture as the number of perimeter lines per row and
      column. Then numbers in blue are the perimeter lines of the object in that column or row and
      the red numbers are the number of perimeter lines of "the box".
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image198.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can see that the perimeter of "the box" is actually the perimeter of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Cool, does that trick work for all shapes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No this trick does not work for shapes that fold back on themselves. Adding one block to our
      example makes the trick not work. Can anyone figure out what makes our trick fail?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image199.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Before you said that we should look at the picture as the number of perimeter lines per row
      and column. In this picture, the number of perimeter lines of the shape does not match the
      number of perimeter lines of "the box."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great Job! In the first column there are four shape perimeter lines and the box only has two.
      So the perimeter of the object is two more than the perimeter of "the box." So the perimeter
      of the shape is eighteen plus two, which is twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So when the picture folds on itself, we have to scan the columns and the rows to see how many
      extra perimeter lines there are. Then we just add that to the perimeter of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good job! Now lets play with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}">Perimeter Explorer </a> applet and see how well our method works.
