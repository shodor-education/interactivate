      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why is there sometimes a number added on to the end of functions but at other times not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> When a number is not added on to the end it is because the number equals 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But what does that number do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It's called the Y-intercept which means that it is the point at which the function intersects
      the Y-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But I thought all points consisted of two coordinates: an X-value and a Y-value.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You're right, but if we know a point is the Y-intercept what can we assume about X?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well...if it is on the Y-axis then X would be 0 wouldn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, this means that we only need one number because we already know that X is 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But how do we know that it is the Y-intercept? Why can't it be the X-intercept?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, the Y-intercept is the place on the graph where the function intersects with the
      Y-axis, so the X-intercept must be what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The place on the graph where the function intersects with the X-axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, so knowing that we can now test for the X and Y-intercepts. Let's do Y first. To start
      you need to make up a linear equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, Y=5X+3
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So, since we know that we are looking for the Y-intercept we can replace x with 0 because we
      already know that coordinate, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Student OK, so then it would be Y=5*0+3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, now can you simplify it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, then it would be just Y=3 because 5*0=0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly! So, when X is 0, the function crosses the Y-axis at Y=3, which is exactly what was
      added on to our equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so when X=0, Y will always be the number added on to the end of the function. Will this
      work for non-linear functions too?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Try it!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span>OK, well...I'll use Y=X
      <sup> 3 </sup> +4X+6. So then I replace X with 0...and since 0
      <sup> 3 </sup> and 4*0 both equal 0 then Y=6. It works every time! But how do we know the number on the end
      isn't the X-intercept?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, to find out you just need to replace Y with 0 this time. So make up a function and try
      it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Okay, Y=4X+6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, now replace Y with 0 and solve the equation for X.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Right, so 0=4X+6, so I would subtract 6 to get -6=4X, and then I would divide both sides by 4
      so it is...-6/4=X.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good Job! You can now see that when Y=0, X does not equal the number added on. So now we know
      that "the number added on" is not the X-intercept, but what did we discover it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The Y-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, now that we know what that number is, what do you think would happen if we changed
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, the Y-intercept would change wouldn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, but what would happen to the entire line?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, it would change because the equation has changed, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, and how would it change?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I'm not sure. Maybe it would curve past the Y-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Not quite right but you are thinking along the right lines. Lets go to
      <a href="{{ '/activities/FunctionFlyer' | relative_url }}">Function Flyer</a> and test it out. OK, enter X+1 in the "Set Function" bar next to f(x)=. What do you see come
      up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It is a diagonal line going through 1 on the Y-axis.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image230.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, now do you see how the 1 in your equation is purple and how there is a purple slider
      bar down below it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes. Does this let me change the Y-intercept?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, now play with the slider and see what happens to the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The line moves up and down!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What happens to the Y-intercept in your equation as you move the slider?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It goes up and down. Whoa, it goes into the negatives. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It just means that the Y-intercept goes below the X-axis on the graph into the negative
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Does this work for all types of functions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, you can try any type of function you want and as long as it is a real function it will
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I understand what the Y-intercept is and what happens when you move it, but what does the
      number next to the X in a linear equation mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question. Whenever a number is next to a variable that means you multiply that number
      with the variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so 3X would be 3*X?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But what does that number mean in the equation? Is that number the X-intercept?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, it is not the X-intercept because as you'll remember from the problem we did earlier, we
      got -6/4 as the X-intercept, but the number next to the X in that problem was a 4. What that
      number actually is is the slope. Do you have any guesses as to what the slope is? Think of it
      like the slope of a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well...then I guess it would be how steep the line is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, the slope tells us how many squares that the line goes up for every square the line
      goes over. The more common way to say that is rise over run. Rise meaning the amount the line
      goes up and run meaning the amount the line goes over in any section of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so if you go up three squares every time you go over 2 squares then the slope would be
      3/2?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> But sometimes I see lines that go down from left to right instead of going up from left to
      right. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, if you go down two for every one that you go over, do you have a guess as to what the
      slope would be?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um...well, the rise over run would still be 2/1 right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> No, not quite because a line with the slope of two would be going up; the slope of a line
      going down would be just the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh! It would be -2/1.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, whenever you have a line going down from left to right than the line has a negative
      slope. Why don't we go to Function Flyer again and see what happens when you change the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I'm at Function Flyer. What do I do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Enter in a linear equation including a slope and a Y-intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK. f(X)=6X+3. It said there was an error in my function!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is not actually your function that is wrong. In Function Flyer, you have to put a
      multiplication sign in between the slope and the variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, OK. So now it is f(X)=6*X+3. This time it gave me two sliders though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, the purple bar matches up with the purple number in your function and the green bar
      matches with the green number in your equation. In this case, purple is the slope and green is
      the Y-intercept. Try moving them around.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> As I move the slope up, the line gets steeper and as I move it down, it gets flatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> At what point do you think the line will be completely flat?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um...if the slope is 0?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, and at what point will the line will be completely vertical?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I don't know, let me try it on Function Flyer. It won't go completely vertical. Why is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is because if you remember about rise and run, even the highest number imaginable would
      still just be the amount that the line rises for every square it goes to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So how you graph a vertical line?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> To graph a vertical line you don't use Y= you use X=. Whatever number X equals is the place
      in the X-axis that the vertical line passes through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so it is impossible to graph a vertical line in Y=mX+b form?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. So, today we have learned what the Y-intercept and slope are and what happens when you
      change these numbers in the equation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I always thought that graphs were just simple lines. I never knew you could do so much with
      them.
    </p>
