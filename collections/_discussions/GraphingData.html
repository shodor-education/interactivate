      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now that we understand bivariate data let's look at a sample set of data. This data set has
      two variables, the arm-span variable and the height variable. Which do you think is the
      independent variable and which do you think is the dependent variable?

      <div class="h-center">

      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, as a human's body grows taller the rest of their body must adjust to this growth.
      Therefore, I think that as you get taller your arm span changes and this means that height is
      the independent variable and that arm span is the dependent variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What you said makes a lot of sense, but this was actually a trick question. In some cases,
      such as this one, the independent variable and the dependent variable are difficult to
      determine. Both the arm span length and the height grow in relation to one another, but
      neither variable necessarily determines the other. Since neither variable is dependent on the
      other it is difficult to label one variable independent and the other variable dependent.
      While in most cases one variable is obviously dependent upon another it is important to keep
      in mind that sometimes this relationship is not able to be determined. Let's see the type of
      relationship that the two variables of arm span length and height have by using the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Regression' | relative_url }}">Regression</a> activity. We can plot the points and see what happens to one variable (in this case we will
      choose the arm span length to represent the dependent variable on the y-axis) as the other
      variable (in this case we will choose the height to represent the independent variable on the
      x-axis) increases. What type of relationship is this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1180.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> It is a positive relationship because as the height of each student increases the arm-span
      length increases as well! Now I understand relationships that exist with bivariate data and
      how to view these relationships on a graph.
