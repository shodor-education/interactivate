      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What types of graphs have you learned?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span>
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/l' | relative_url }}">line graphs</a>,
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">bar graphs</a>, and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">histograms</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What type of graph do you think you would use in this scenario: you have a certain amount of
      money you can spend each month and you want to record how much you are spending in different
      categories?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Um, I think a histogram could work for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It could, but there is another type of graph that would work too: a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">pie graph</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How do you know when to use a pie graph and when to use a histogram?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> A pie graph works well for data with categories and for data that has a total, like 24 hours
      in a day, or a budget like I mentioned before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why is a pie chart better for that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Lets try using the example of a budget to make a pie chart and I think you will see why. What
      are some categories you might spend money on?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Clothes, food, video games, gifts, savings, and music.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Ok, lets say your parents give you $100 a month for allowance, how much money would you spend
      in each of those categories?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> $20 on clothes, $15 on food, $30 on video games, $10 on gifts, $10 for savings, and $15 on
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Alright now we can use the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/CircleGraph' | relative_url }}">circle graph</a> activity to create a pie chart based on your data. Enter your data into the box below the
      circle and then click "Update Chart."

      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1218.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Maybe I should cut back on video games!
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1219.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Maybe you should! Lets see what happens if you decrease your spending in that category.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The other sections got bigger!
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1220.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, the sections got bigger because in a pie chart each category is proportional to the
      other categories. Pie charts provide a very clear image of how categories relate to one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh! Is that what makes it different from a histogram?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Both histograms and pie charts show the relationships between categories, but in different
      ways. However, what makes a pie chart different from a histogram is that you can visually see
      the categories making up portions of a whole. Pie charts make it very clear how one category
      compares to the total. In other words, pie charts make it easier to see how much of the whole
      each category represents.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I understand! Using the pie chart, it was easy for me to see just how much of my total money
      I would spend on video games and how much I would spend on food.
    </p>
