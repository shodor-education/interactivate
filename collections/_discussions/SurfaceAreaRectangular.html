      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can anyone tell me what surface area means?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Surface area is the number of square units that are needed to cover the surface of a three
      dimensional figure.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Surface area is just what you see of a three-dimensional object, not what is inside.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good, how do you find the surface area of a three dimensional object?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well, there are a lot of three dimensional objects such as cones, rectangular prisms and
      triangular prisms. The formula for finding surface area cannot be the same for all of these
      figures.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is true! Three-dimensional figures have different formulas for surface area depending on
      their shape. Let's examine the surface area specifically of a rectangular prism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/cubeimg.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Since we are finding the surface area of this shape, how many sides will we need to include?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> This is a rectangular prism so it has six sides. We have to make sure to count how many
      square units are on each of the six sides. That will give us the entire area that covers the
      shape.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! Let's first look at the top surface of this figure. How many square units cover this
      rectangular surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/cube2img.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> There are 15 square units.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> How did you find that?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I counted each square unit.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> I got 15, too. I knew that to find the area of a rectangle you can multiply the length by the
      width so I multiplied the length (5) by the width (3).
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right. You can find how many square units there are in a rectangle either by counting
      each one or by multiplying the length by the width. Now, are there any other surfaces on this
      rectangular prism that would be identical to the one we just worked with?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The surface directly below this (the base of the rectangular prism) should have the same
      amount of square units.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is true, but why?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, the width of the flat rectangular shape will be the same (3) and the length of the
      shape will be the same (5) so that means that the area should be the same as well!
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Good. Now we have two of the surfaces covered (each fifteen square units). Let's move to the
      side of the shape facing towards the right. How many square units are on this surface?
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/cube3img.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> There are 20 square units on this surface!
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. And is there another surface identical to this one on the rectangular prism?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Yes, the surface directly opposite of this one would be identical since it, too, would have a
      length of five and a width of four.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Excellent. Now we have four surfaces covered. Two of them are 15 units each, and two of them
      are 20 units each. Lets take a look at the last side that we can see of this three dimensional
      figure:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/cube4img.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> This surface has 12 square units.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Plus, another surface identical to it would be on the other side of the rectangular prism.
      That means there are two surfaces with 12 square units.
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Right! So we have:
      <ul>
        <li>
          two surfaces that are 15 units
        </li>
        <li>
          two surfaces that are 20 units
        </li>
        <li>
          two surfaces that are 12 units.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found the area of six surfaces and rectangular prisms have six surfaces so that means
      that we have found all that we need. Now, what is the total surface area of the rectangular
      prism?
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> To find the total surface area I would need to add all of the separate areas that I found
      together. It would be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          15+15+
        </li>
        <li>
          20+20+
        </li>
        <li>
          12+12 = 94 square units!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p />
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! You just found the surface area of a rectangular prism!
    </p>
    <p />
