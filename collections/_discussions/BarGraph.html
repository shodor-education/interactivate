      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What do you use
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">bar graph</a> for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Bar graphs compare measurements of different values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Why do you need a graph? Why can't you just use numbers or tallies?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, with a bar graph we can look quickly at the graph and know some important information
      about the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What kind of information?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Lets look at a bar graph and see if you can tell. Lets look at different hair colors in a
      classroom of twenty students.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1225.png' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So what do we find from this chart?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> There are more students with brown hair than any other color and red hair is the least common
      hair color.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good! So without knowing that there are exactly 8 brunettes and 2 redheads, you know the most
      and least common colors. What other information can you tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> None of the bars are the same height, which means there are different amounts of people with
      each hair color. None of the bars are higher than 8, which means that there is no hair color
      that more than 8 people have. None of the bars are shorter than 2, which means at least two
      students have each hair color.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, these are all things that a bar graph can tell as at a quick glance; it would take
      much longer to find out all of this information using tallies or numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I see now why bar graphs are used so often!
    </p>
