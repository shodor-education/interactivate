      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now I would like to help you with another graphing method that allows you to compare
      different categories of data. It is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">box plot</a>. It looks something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image38.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one of the vertical lines represents an important number related to the data set: The
      first and last line (leftmost and rightmost) are drawn at the lowest and highest data values.
      The three lines that form the box are drawn 25%, 50%, and 75% of the way through the data.
      These five numbers, the least, the 25%, the 50%, the 75%, and the greatest, together are
      called a 5 number summary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Summary of what, the data?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. In the past we have talked about the mean of the data being the average of all of the
      data points. There is another important 'middle' number. It is called the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">median</a> (M).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I know that. The median is the mid-point of the data set. If you were to line up the data set
      from least to greatest, split the number of data points in half, put the lower half of the
      data points on one side of the scale and the upper half of the data points on the other side
      of the scale, the median would be data value at the balancing point if there is an odd number
      of data points like this for data points 1 1 3 7 8 8 9:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image39.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right, the quantity of numbers on either side of the scale is the same. But keep in
      mind, if you have an even quantity of numbers, you average the two middle numbers and report
      their average as the median. You do not add this number to the list. It is simply the median
      value, and it marks the fiftieth percentile of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also remember not to get median confused with the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">mean</a>. The median has to do with the number of data points where the mean deals with the value of
      the data points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's look at splitting the halves in half in order to find the ends of the box in the box
      plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You mean splitting the data into quarters?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. We want to talk about the twenty-fifth and the seventy-fifth percentiles of the data.
      The twenty-fifth percentile is called the
      <strong>first quartile (Q1)</strong>or the
      <strong>lower quartile</strong> and the seventy-fifth percentile is the
      <strong>third quartile (Q3)</strong> or
      <strong>upper quartile</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What exactly is a quartile?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The lower quartile is the median of the first 50% of the data. And the upper quartile is the
      median of the last 50% of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So is it just another point in the data set?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Much like the median, as long as there is an odd number of data points in the first or last
      50% of the data. If there is an even number of data points then the quartile is the average of
      the two middle numbers, just like when we found the median.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two possible ways of finding the quartiles. Neither of these methods is considered
      standard over the other way of finding the upper and lower quartiles so your final answer will
      depend on which method you choose to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What are the different methods?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, it depends on whether or not the median is part of the data set. If the median is not
      part of the original data set then you just use the numbers on one side of the median
      depending on which quartile you are trying to calculate. However, it gets a little tricky when
      you are trying to calculate the upper and lower quartiles of a data set in which the median is
      a number in the set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What do you mean, "it gets tricky?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I mean there are two different ways people calculate the quartile when the median is a number
      in the data set. One method people use, is to include the median in the calculation of both
      the upper and lower quartiles. The second way people calculate the upper and lower quartiles
      is to exclude the median from the calculation of both quartiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember how we found the median to begin with?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, we took the middle number of the data set if the set had an odd number of values, and we
      averaged the two middle digits if there was an even quantity of numbers in the data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct, and we use a similar method to find the different quartiles. If we choose to use the
      median in our calculations on sets where the median is a number in the data set, then to find
      the lower quartile we need to look at all of the digits from the lowest value through the
      median and calculate the median of those numbers. The median of the lower half of the data set
      is the first quartile. Can you figure out how we will calculate the third quartile?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> My guess is, you look at all the numbers from the median to the greatest number, calculate
      their median and that number will be equal to the third quartile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are absolutely correct. Do you have any questions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You covered how to calculate the quartiles when the median is part of the data set but, what
      if the median is not a part of the data set?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good question! If the median is not part of the data set and you want to calculate the upper
      quartile then you just calculate the median of the numbers in the upper 50% of the data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> And for the lower quartile you just find the median of the lower 50% of the data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Exactly, now do you want to give me a couple of data sets in which to calculate the median?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Let's use 2 6 7 10 14 15 since it has an even number of numbers in the set, and then we can
      use 1 4 9 12 16 23 24 for an odd sized data set. The median for the first set is 8.5 - I
      averaged 7 and 10. The median for the second set is 12, the middle number.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now for the quartiles. For 2 6 7 10 14 15 the first quartile is equal to 6 and the
      third quartile equal to 14:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image40.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Right, I got that. Let me try the other set: 1 4 9 12 16 23 24. If I include the median to
      calculate the quartiles then the first quartile is the average of 4 and 9 or 6.5 and the third
      quartile is the average of 16 and 23 or 19.5. If I do not include the median to calculate the
      quartiles then the lower quartile is 4 and the upper quartile is 23.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image1113.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! That was great. So far we have calculated the median, first quartile, and the third
      quartile for the second data set. What else do we need to complete our five number summary?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The highest and lowest values of the data set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right again. We then use those five numbers in drawing our box plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Okay.

    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The last couple of numbers that are of interest are the ranges. The range of the data set is
      the greatest value minus the smallest value. The interquartile range is when you subtract the
      first quartile from the third quartile. Do you know what the interquartile range represents?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The middle fifty percent of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. And the middle fifty percent of the data determines the length of the box. So for the
      data set 1 4 9 12 16 23 24 here is our box plot:
