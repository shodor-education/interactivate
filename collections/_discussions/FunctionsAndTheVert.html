      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I am having some trouble deciding whether some of the more complex graphs are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">functions</a> or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are many ways to tell if it is a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Are there any that can be done by just looking at the graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> As a matter of fact there is. It is called the vertical line test.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What does a vertical line have to do with functions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Look at one of the graphs you have a question about. Then take a vertical line and place it
      on the graph. If the graph is a function, then no matter where on the graph you place the
      vertical line, the graph should only cross the vertical line once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Really? Does that work all of the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, all of the time. Let's try one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image180.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you tell me if that is a function in that plot?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes, that is. I can't put a vertical line anywhere on this graph and have it touch the
      function more than once. This works great, especially if I can see the grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What about common shapes like circles and squares?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They are not functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you tell me why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> They would not pass the vertical line test.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Why don't they pass?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Both of those shapes pass through the vertical line twice in lots of places! Look, here's
      just one example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image181.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes! Remember that hitting the vertical line more than once would mean that there are more
      than one y values for certain x values. This works for formulas when you are not sure whether
      they are functions. Any time you get more than one y value when you fill in an x value, it
      means that the formula is not a function. Having at most one y value for every x value means
      that there is a well-defined relationship, or in other words, a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> That means that graphs such as x = 2 are not functions but graphs such as y = 2 are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You are correct. Now lets try a harder one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image182.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is going on at x=7? It looks like the graph jumps down?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's right. It is up on the flat part at x=7, but for x larger than 7 it is on the curvy
      part. That colored in dot tells us that at 7 we should use the y-value 9, the dot with no
      shading tells us that the curvy part of the graph is what to use for anything larger than x =
      7, but not for 7 itself. We call this a piecewise graph, and when we have this situation, we
      need to be told where the open and closed (filled or not) circles are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> If that is how you read it, then this is a function. Nowhere on this graph can I make a
      vertical line touch the function in more than one place. This makes things a lot easier and it
      makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Can you draw me a graph that is not a function?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Sure! Here's one:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image183.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      What are these called?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, every graph that describes a relationship between x and y is called a
      <strong>relation</strong>. Also, graphs that are drawn on the cartesian plane are called
      <strong>plane curves</strong>,
      <strong>2-dimensional curves</strong>, or simply
      <strong>curves</strong>. So, functions are all of these things, but to answer your question, graphs that are not
      functions can be called by any of these names.
    </p>
