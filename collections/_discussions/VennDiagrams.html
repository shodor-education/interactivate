      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> If I have two sets of numbers, is it possible for the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/s' | relative_url }}">sets</a> to have
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">elements</a> in common? Can an element be in both sets?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well... 5 is an odd number, and it's also a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">prime number</a>....
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great! So, elements can be part of two sets at once. I'm going to draw a picture to represent
      that, and you all can help me put some elements in the correct place.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image179.GIF' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I put 5 in the place where these two circles overlap. Why do you think that I did that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, it's a prime number and an odd number, so the way you drew it, it's clear that it is a
      part of both circles!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So what should we call those circles?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> They are sets, aren't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Wonderful! Can anyone think of another number that I could put in this diagram? What about a
      number that is odd, but that isn't prime?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 3:</span> You could put the number nine in the odd number circle, but not in the prime number circle,
      because it's divisible by 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Perfect answer! What we are making here is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">Venn Diagram</a>. Sometimes they have two circles, like the one we have drawn here, and sometimes they have
      more! Let's put a few more elements in this one, then we can try to create a Venn diagram with
      three circles...
    </p>

      Continue to allow students to suggest elements until you feel they understand Venn diagrams.
