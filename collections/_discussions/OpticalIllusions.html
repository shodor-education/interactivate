      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Our brains play an important part in how we perceive objects. For example, take a look at
      this tessellation and describe what you see:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/image144.jpg' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I see rows of crooked lines with a distorted checkerboard pattern in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Are you sure the lines are crooked?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Yes! They look wider at one end than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Hold a ruler or other straight edge along the horizontal lines in the image and tell me what
      you observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> (holding a ruler to the image) It doesn't seem possible, but the lines actually are straight!
      Why do they appear to be crooked?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It is an example of an
      <strong>optical illusion</strong>: something that appears to our eyes to have an effect that it does not really have. The
      placement of the alternating dark and light squares "tricks" our eyes into seeing the
      horizontal lines as crooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, that reminds me of another similar "trick" my brother showed me. I will draw two lines,
      and you tell me which one is longer:
      <pre>
        <div class="h-center">
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1187.png' | relative_url }}" />
        </div>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> The bottom line is longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> It certainly looks that way, but this is another famous optical illusion. Both lines are the
      exact same length. The arrows lead our eyes to see the top one as shorter, because the lines
      draw our eyes together. The bottom one appears longer, because our eyes follow the outward
      arrows away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> You already knew that one!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, there are many well known optical illusions we can learn about. After class you can do
      some research to find more! Did you know that
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ColorTessellations' | relative_url }}">color</a> also affects the way we perceive tessellations?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, that should be an interesting lesson, too!
    </p>
    <p />
