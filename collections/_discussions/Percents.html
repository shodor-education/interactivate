      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> How are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/f' | relative_url }}">fractions</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">percents</a> related to each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Both fractions and percents represent parts of a whole. Where a fraction is a part of the
      amount of the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">denominator</a>, a percent is always some part of 100. The word "percent" comes from Latin and means, "part
      of one hundred".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So if I have fifty parts of one hundred, that is fifty percent, or 50%, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, and to express 50% as a fraction, think of it this way; it is fifty parts out of one
      hundred or 50/100.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, that makes sense. And it looks like I can reduce that fraction by dividing both numbers
      by 50.
    </p>
    <p>
      50&divide;50=1 and 100&divide;50=2 so the reduced fraction is 1/2
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good work! Fifty percent is one half. Now let's try another. Suppose I have a fraction of
      1/5. How would I convert that to a percent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, if a percent is some part of 100, then I will multiply 1/5 by 100.
    </p>
    <p>
      1/5 x 100 is the same as 1/5 x 100/1, and I multiply across: 1*100=100 in the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/n' | relative_url }}">numerator</a> and 5*1=5 in the denominator to show that 100/5 = 20
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. So 1/5 is the same as 20%.
    </p>
