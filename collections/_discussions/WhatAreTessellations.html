      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Shapes with more than two sides are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">polygons</a>. The sides can be of any length, and where two sides meet, an angle is formed. Polygons with
      sides of equal length and equal angles are called
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/r' | relative_url }}">regular polygons</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="h-center">
      Triangles = three sides
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And so on. Most of the names are derived using Latin or Greek prefixes for the number of
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so that means if we continue with the names:
      <table class="h-center">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>6</strong> = Hexagon
          </td>
          <td>
            <strong>9</strong> = Nonagon
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>7</strong> = Heptagon
          </td>
          <td>
            <strong>10</strong> = Decagon
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <strong>8</strong> = Octagon
          </td>
          <td>
            <strong>11</strong> = Undecagon
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right. So using your table above, what would this object be called?
    </p>
    <p class="h-center">
      <img src="{{ 'img/image149.gif' | relative_url }}" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A hexagon, a six-sided shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good. Now, try picturing many hexagons placed all around each other in all directions on a
      flat surface. What would it be like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> A honeycomb made by bees!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, that's right. It would also be what is called a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/t' | relative_url }}">tessellation</a>: a repeating polygonal shape with no gaps or overlapping sections spread across a plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh. What is "polygonal"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Any shape that qualifies as a polygon: any closed plane figure with more than two sides. By
      "closed plane," that means the shape is one that can lie flat on a plane surface, and where
      there are no openings in the shape--the sides join together to form one "piece".
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK. So a tessellation can be any polygon that forms a repeating pattern across a flat surface
      and does not overlap or leave gaps anywhere. I don't think all regular polygons will
      tessellate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good hypothesis. You will get a chance to test it! As we learn more about tessellations, you
      will see how they are used many places in the world. There are also many observations you can
      make by examining different types of tessellations, which we will see in the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tessellate' | relative_url }}">Tessellation Activity</a> .
