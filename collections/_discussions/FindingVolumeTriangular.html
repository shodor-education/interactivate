    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> How can we find out how much a three dimensional object can hold inside (its
    <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">volume</a>)?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, there are different methods for finding volume depending on the three dimensional shape.
    Let's look at a three dimensional triangular shape. How do you think we should solve for the
    volume of this shape?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, to find the area of a flat triangle we would multiply one half times the base length
    times the height. Maybe we do something like that to find the volume of a three dimensional
    triangle shape?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Good thinking! You are very close. A flat shape is called a two-dimensional shape because it
    has two dimensions (in the case of a triangle they are often called base and height) while a
    three dimensional shape will have three dimensions. Let's look at a three dimensional triangular
    shape (a triangular prism):
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/VolTri.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    This shape has a base width and a base height (we will call this the base depth) just like you
    mentioned flat triangles having, but what else does a three dimensional shape have that flat
    shapes don't? What is the extra dimension?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> There is another side that shows you how high it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! This is called the prism height! The prism height is what makes this a three dimensional
    figure since there are a total of three dimensions: base width, base depth, and prism height!
    All of these dimensions are used to find the volume of a triangular prism. To find the area of a
    two dimensional triangle we multiply one half of the base width by the base height so lets start
    with finding the area of a two dimensional part of the triangular prism. We will first look at
    the top layer of the triangular prism when there is base width and base depth but no prism
    height.

    </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> What is the base width of this shape?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> 4! There are four full cubes along the base of the triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/VolTri3.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great, so the base width is 4 units, now what is the base depth of the triangle? Remember, base
    depth is the distance from the middle of the base to the top point of the triangle (the apex).
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> The base depth is 6 units! There is a length of six cubes from the base of the triangle to the
    top of the triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/VolTri4.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is right! Now we can find the area of this flat triangular shape. What do I do to find the
    area?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> You multiply 1/2 to the base width (4) to the base depth (6). The answer is 12 units!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Correct! Now, we haven't found the volume yet, what are we missing?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We need to include the prism height!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right, let's take another look at our three dimensional shape:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/VolTri5.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> See the flat triangular shape we looked at is only one layer of this big shape. Think about it
    like this: the flat shape that we just looked at is stacked on other shapes identical to itself.
    How many of the flat shapes are stacked up in this 3 dimensional figure?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Well, there is one layer on the top, another layer of the same shape below it, and then the
    layer that is on the bottom. There are 3 layers total!
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/VolTri6.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job. The number of layers represents our prism height!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> So our third dimension, prism height, is 3 units?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes. Now, knowing that in the three dimensional shape there are three layers of the flat shape
    we looked at, and knowing that the flat shape has an area of 12 square units, how do you think
    we will find the volume?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> If there are three layers, each with an area of 12 square units, we can add 12+12+12 and that
    will give us the total volume!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We could also multiply the area of the flat shape, 12, by 3. That is the same thing as adding
    an area of 12 three times.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! And what do you get when you multiply 12 by 3?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> 36! The volume of the three dimensional object is 36 cubic units!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Great job! You found the volume of a triangular prism. Here are the steps that we took to find
    our answer:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1/2 x Base Width x Base Depth = Area of the flat triangular shape
      </li>
      <li>
        Area x Prism Height = Volume of the triangular prism
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So, in order to find the volume of a triangular prism we multiply 1/2 by base width by base
    depth by prism height.
  </p>
