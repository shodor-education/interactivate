      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> The vertical scale can really change the appearance of a
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/h' | relative_url }}">histogram</a> or
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">bar graph</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Oh yeah. These two pictures represent the same data set:
    </p>
    <div class="h-center">
      <p>
        <img src="{{ 'img/image215.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="{{ 'img/image960.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Are they
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/HistogramsVsBarGraph' | relative_url }}">histograms or bar graphs</a> ?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> They are
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">bar graphs</a>. I had measurements of unemployment rates in mind. The first one shows that unemployment
      stayed almost the same over the three years pictured, and the second one shows that it was
      declining rapidly. I would use the second one if I were a mayor of the town we are talking
      about running for the second term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> And I would use the first one if I were a competing candidate. Can you please tell us the
      scales?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> In both Picture 1 and Picture 2, each bar represents one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Oh, you did say they talk about a three year period. What about the vertical scales?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> In Picture 1, the vertical scale is 30 (unemployed) per unit length. In Picture 2, the
      vertical scale is 10 per unit. They also start from different values. For the first one, the
      vertical count starts from zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> I can figure out when the second one starts! Picture 1 shows 270 unemployed for the first
      year (9 units, 30 unemployed per unit, starting from 0). Picture 2 has to show the same
      number. There are 7 units for the first year in Picture 2. With 10 per unit, it makes 70
      unemployed. So the count along the vertical axis of Picture 2 has to start from 200, with 10
      (unemployed) per unit length.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let us summarize. If the vertical scale of a graph has less values per unit length, what does
      it do for people's impression of the graph?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> It "stretches" the graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> It makes the graph look more jumpy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Or more dramatic. It exaggerates any differences, as we saw in Picture 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> But if we make the vertical scale to have more values per unit length, as in Picture 1, the
      graph will look smoothed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> The differences are less visible this way. Also, if you cut off the lower part of the graph,
      as in Picture 2, the graph looks jumpier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Now we are ready to work as public relations persons!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Oh, maybe there is a thing or two about data presentation and mis-presentation that you may
      want to learn before applying for the job...
