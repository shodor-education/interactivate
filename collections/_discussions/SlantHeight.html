    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> What is the slant height of a triangular prism?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's start with looking at the triangle portion of a triangular prism.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/Slant3.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> The four cubic units on the wide part of the triangle represent the base width of the triangle.
    The distance from the middle of the base width to the top peak of the triangle is the base
    depth. The actual lengths of the triangle's edges that run from the base to the top peak of the
    triangle represent the slant height.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/Slant2.png' | relative_url }}" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, so the slant height is 6 units, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Actually, no. The slant height is going to be a bit more than the base depth because the
    distance from the corner of the base edge to the top peak (representing slant height) is greater
    than the distance from the center of the base edge straight up to the top peak (representing
    base depth).
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I can see how that would be longer, how much longer is it?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, let's try to figure out what the slant height would be for this triangular prism and we
    can see for ourselves. How are we going to find the measurement of one of the diagonal sides of
    the triangle representing the slant height?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, we could use the Pythagorean theorem! We know the base depth of the triangle (6), which
    will be one leg of the triangle. That line will bisect the base width and create a right
    triangle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Right! Since we are bisecting the base width what will the part that forms a right triangle
    measure?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Bisect means to divide into two equal parts so the base width (4) divided by 2 would be two.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> So the triangle that we created within this triangle has one leg that measures 6 (the base
    depth) one leg that measures 2 (half of the base width) and the diagonal, which represents the
    slant height of the triangle. What next?
  </p>
  <p>
    <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/SlantHeight.png' | relative_url }}" which="thumb" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Well, now I can apply Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem is: a
    <sup>2</sup> + b
    <sup>2</sup> = c
    <sup>2</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Which variable represents the slant height?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> The slant height is c because the hypoteneuse of a right triangle is always represented by the
    variable c while the two legs that form the right angle are variables a and b.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> You really know how to use this equation! What do you do next?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I plug in the values. One leg was 2 units and the other leg was 6 units so:
  </p>
  <p>
    (2)
    <sup>2</sup> + (6)
    <sup>2</sup> = (c)
    <sup>2</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    4 + 36 = c
    <sup>2</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    40 = c
    <sup>2</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    c= &radic;40
  </p>
  <p>
    So c is about 6.32 units
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Wow you just found the slant height! Great work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So the slant height for this example would be 6.32 because that is the length of each edge that
    runs from the base of the shape to the top peak!
