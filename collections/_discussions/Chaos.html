      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> I have played the so-called
      <a href="{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}">Chaos Game</a> and experimented with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Fire' | relative_url }}">Simple Forest Fire</a>. Both of these are somehow related to chaos. I'm confused though because I thought chaos was
      a word to describe disorder such as the chaos of New York traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Well, that is one definition of chaos, but the term chaos is also used to express a
      mathematical theory. You are thinking of chaos in the vernacular sense, but for this activity
      it is representing a mathematical idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> OK, I'll try to think of it as a mathematical term. In that case, what is
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">chaos</a>??
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Let's see if you can figure it out. Chaos can be present in many ways. In the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}">Chaos Game</a> it's present when even though the result of each individual throw of the die is unpredictable
      there is an overall pattern resulting from many throws of the die. In the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Fire' | relative_url }}">Fire</a>!! activity a small change in the beginning probability of burn resulted in different overall
      percentages of the forest burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Oh, I think I'm getting it. Chaos is when there is an overall pattern that results from
      seemingly random events.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, you
      <em>are</em> getting it. But there is a little more than just that. Chaos is also present when the final
      outcome of a chain of events becomes unpredictable because of a small change in the events
      leading up to the outcome. This can also be seen in the Fire!! activity. By slowly changing
      the probability of burn, the resulting overall percent of the forest burned fluctuates
      drastically.

      E. N. Lorenz first stumbled upon this latter idea in 1956 when he was trying to look at
      modeling the weather using mathematical equations. He found some good equations to work with
      (they now bear his name) and saw that if he made very small changes to the initial inputs for
      the weather, he got dramatically different, unpredictable results (outputs). Moreover, the
      further into the future he tried to predict, the worse it got!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> Weather forecasters seem to be able to predict the weather now at least for a little while
      into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That's because they've had over 40 years to find better equations. But they still don't have
      great predictions past two or three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student:</span> So if chaos is present, we can't do anything with our computer information? If it is not good
      for predicting, why do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> There are several reasons to look at chaos. Think about the Chaos game. The unpredictability
      on the small scale (where to move next) results in a predictable fractal shape! Chaos and
      Fractals are very closely linked. Chaotic things can end up with very interesting -- and
      predictable -- fractal patterns. The particular individual numbers are not predictable, but
      the overall pattern can be. With chaotic systems like weather, we just have to be careful
      about how far into the future we can predict.
