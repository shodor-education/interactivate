    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Without using the precise terminology we have learned about two different types of data. The
    names for these are "categorical" and "numerical." Can anyone guess what these terms might mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Well numerical is like number, so maybe that is data with numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. If numerical data refers to data that uses numbers, what might categorical data
    mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Something to do with categories?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> Maybe like what you choose from a multiple-choice question. Could that be categorical data?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. You are both correct. Categorical data is data that is defined by words or has a
    limited number of answer options. Let's think of questions that you could ask the entire class
    and the answers would be considered categorical data?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> What if we asked everybody about their favorite ice cream flavor?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Yes, that would be categorical data because there is a limited number of answer choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> Couldn't there be an infinite number of ice cream flavors?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Technically yes, there could be a very large number of ice cream flavors. In this case, we
    would probably want to condense all of the information into a few categories anyways. Other
    examples?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> How about eye color?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Very good. We could survey the entire class and find a limited number of eye colors. What are
    some examples of questions we could ask and get back numerical data?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student:</span> We could ask for each person's height.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is a great example of numerical data as every person would respond with a number and they
    could answer with specific numbers , such as 5 feet 4 and one half inches. Any other examples?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> We could ask everyone for their age.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> That is a tricky one. If we ask people and they respond "14", "12", etc, that would really be
    categorical data. The categories would be each age and there would be a limited number of
    categories. If the class responded with how many days hold they are, we could consider that
    numerical data as there are a lot more potential answer choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 1:</span> That is confusing. So there are some questions you could ask and the class would respond with
    numbers, but it would be considered categorical?
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> I think you've got it! Another example might be if we asked everyone how many pets they have.
    The answers would all be whole numbers greater than or equal to zero. For data to be numerical
    the answer choices need to possibly include decimals or fractions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Student 2:</span> I think I get it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="mentor">Mentor:</span> Now you can determine what type of data you have and determine which type of graph is best for
    your data.
