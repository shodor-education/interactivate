      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: So, if we know that we can find the area of a two-dimensional figure,do you think that it is
      possible to find the area of a three dimensional figure? In fact, who can tell me what a three
      dimensional figure is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: A three dimensional figure is like a ball or a cube--it's not flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: That's right. Now, can anyone say something about what it might mean to find the area of
      such a figure?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: When you say "find the area", do you mean the outside, or are the insides included?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Well, it depends. There's actually no such thing as finding the "area" of a cube. Instead,
      we have the terms "volume" and "surface area". Let's talk about volume first. When you say
      "find the area" of a square, do you mean the outside, or are the insides included?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: We just look at the space it takes up on the paper; we assume the edges of the square have a
      width of zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Precisely! Now imagine looking at the amount of space a cube takes up in 3 dimensions. We
      call that measure the volume of the cube.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: How do you measure the volume?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Just as you measure and multiply the length and width of a rectangle to find its area, you
      multiply the length, width, and height of a 3-D object like a cube to find its volume. The
      three variables multiplied give it three dimensions, thus the volume, rather than simply the
      area. What do you suppose are the units for volume?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: Well, if there are three terms, all in inches, then it would be inches * inches * inches,
      which is inches cubed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: How is this different from the units when you find area?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: Well, area is "squared" because you're just multiplying inches * inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Exactly! Area is "squared" and volume is "cubed". How do you think that relates to their
      meaning?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: You find the area of a square or other two-dimensional objects, but you find the volume of
      three-dimensional objects like cubes!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Good, we now know how to measure how much space an object takes up. But what about the
      outside of the object, as you mentioned earlier? What do you think "surface area" is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: That sounds like it would be just the outsides--the area that is on the surface, which I can
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Very well said! Surface area is the area of the surface of the three-dimensional shape. How
      would you calculate something like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: It seems almost too simple, but couldn't I just find the area of each two-dimensional face ,
      then add the areas up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: Absolutely! It is that simple. Almost all three dimensional objects you'll deal with are
      made up of two-dimensional faces that are just squares, triangles, etc, and the ones that are
      curved like spheres will have their own special formulas for surface area. Of course, the
      units for that are easy to find, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Student</span>: Yep, it's just the standard units for area - units * units or units squared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="mentor">Mentor</span>: You've got it! Now you're ready to try to solve some problems involving surface area and
      volume.
