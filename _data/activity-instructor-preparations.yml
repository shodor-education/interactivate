- "give implicit directions on what they are to do. For example \"Today we are going to find out about prisoners, escapees, and complex numbers by using the Two-Variable Function Pump activity and it's worksheet...\""
- "answer the question \"What is a prisoner and what is an escapee?\""
- "discuss complex numbers, and how to plot points"
VennDiagrams:
- "explain all vocabulary words used in the applet."
- "explain what happens when the object being classified does not fall under the categories of any of the circles"
- "give the categories for the class Venn diagram for question three in the exploration questions."
VerticalLineTest:
- "give implicit directions on what they are to do. For example, \"Today we are going to explore theworld of functions ... we are going to make lines and test them... then we will try to answer theexploration questions...\""
- "answer the question \"Why does the vertical line test work\"?"
- "discuss functions, inputs, and outputs"
WholeNumberCruncher:
- "Encourage students to not give up and give hints if they are stuck"
- "Explain the properties of a function"
- "After the students have been working, explain a higher level strategy for finding the result: use 0 first and if the result is a whole number then that is the +/- component; if the result is 0, then it is a multiplication situation and plugging in 1 will find the solution."
