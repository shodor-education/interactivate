Since distances are unchanged, all the other points can be thought of as having moved on circles whose center is the center of the rotation. The \"angle\" of the rotation is how far around the circles the points travel. A rotation in three-dimensional space is a rigid motion that keeps the points on one line fixed, called the \"axis\" of the rotation, with the rest of the points moving some constant angle around circles centered on and perpendicular to the axis."

  definition: "A theory of probability is a way of understanding probability statements. That is, a theory of probability connects the mathematics of probability, which is the set of consequences of the axioms of probability, with the real world of observation and experiment. There are several common theories of probability. According to the frequency theory of probability, the probability of an event is the limit of the percentage of times that the event occurs in repeated, independent trials under essentially the same circumstances. According to the subjective theory of probability, probability is a number that measures how strongly we believe an event will occur. The number is on a scale of 0% to 100% (or 0 to 1), with 0% indicating that we are completely sure it won't occur, and 100% indicating that we are completely sure that it will occur.
