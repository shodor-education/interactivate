- activity: "AdjustableSpinner"
  reason: "The Adjustable Spinner activity is similar to Spinner except that with this activity, the user can also change the size of the sections of the spinner.  This is a nice tool for seeing how experimental results approach theoretical with large numbers of trials."
  textbook-section: "792"
- activity: "AdjustableSpinner"
  reason: "Adjustable Spinner works well with the experimental probability concepts presented in the text such as  simulating the launches for question 13. This could be accomplished in addition to the actual experiments being completed in class. This activity gives students opportunities to experiment with large numbers of launches. "
  textbook-section: "858"
- activity: "BoundFractionFinder"
  reason: "Students build fraction sense with the Bounded Fraction Finder activity. It lends to checking some of the inequalities from the section in the book. This activity can be used to check the inequalities presented in this section of the text."
  textbook-section: "808"
- activity: "BoxPlot"
  reason: "Box Plot can be used to make statements and draw conclusions about the chosen plots, as in the textbook. Students do not construct the actual plot at this time in the text so this is a good tool where they can create their own plots without needing to know all the details. This activity gives lots of practice with the interpretation of the plots. "
  textbook-section: "854"
- activity: "BoxPlot"
  reason: "Students have already encountered the Box Plot activity but now students are expected how to build the plot on their own. Following the lesson in the book, this activity could be used to construct several other plots and practice the skill. The \"ready made\" plots from the activity could also be used here to review the components of a box plot."
  textbook-section: "865"
- activity: "BoxPlot"
  reason: "Box Plot 1 and Box Plot 2 differ as to how the lower and upper quartiles are calculated because staticians do not agree on which method to use. In Book 3's key Concepts, the definition of the lower quartile is the median of the data values that occur before the median, and the upper quartile is the median of the data values that occur after the median which equates to Box Plot 2.  This could be an interesting investigation for students."
  textbook-section: "871"
- activity: "CaesarCipher"
  reason: "Both the Caesar's Cipher and the Caesar's Cipher II activity give further practice with encoding and decoding and should provide a natural extention from this section if the text. "
  textbook-section: "842"
- activity: "CaesarCipherTwo"
  reason: "Both the Caesar's Cipher and the Caesar's Cipher II activity give further practice with encoding and decoding and should provide a natural extention from this section if the text. "
  textbook-section: "842"
- activity: "CantorComb"
  reason: "Cantor's Comb is a visualization of the Cantor Set.  In this activity, there is a line segment whose length is provided.  The user picks a fraction to be removed from the line, and then clicks \"next step\" to see this fraction removed.  Clicking \"next step\" again removes this fraction again from the new line.  This can be done several times, and each time, the new length of the line segment is displayed.  The connection to fraction multiplication is a bit challenging, so this would be a good activity for students who are looking for more exploration than provided in the text."
  textbook-section: "800"
- activity: "Converter"
  reason: "Converter gives a quick look at decimal/fraction equivalents, which is about all that is necessary here in this section in regards to converting. The feature with the repeating decimals should prove interesting to students as well. A few of he exercises in the text do have these."
  textbook-section: "808"
- activity: "Converter"
  reason: "The Converter activity could be used for checking and for review at this point in the text. This section is more about number sense and comparisons than straight conversions so the activity would need to be incorporated in a lesson to develop that number sense.  "
  textbook-section: "836"
- activity: "DataFlyer"
  reason: "Data Flyer works similarly to Graphit but has more options. Of particular use is the slider to help students understand the changing of constants in a function does not in essence change its shape. Students should get a better feel for the meaning of a function after playing with this activity a little though they will need guidance from their instructor. It will provide a nice challenge for students who need it, when used as an extension activity."
  textbook-section: "835"
- activity: "DataFlyer"
  reason: "Similar to the Graphit activity when used at this level, Data Flyer allows students to plot ordered pairs and functions on the same graph. This is a good tie-in, as well as possible extension, for this section of the text. Data Flyer does incorporate a slider bar to manipulate the graph of the function through changing the function's coefficiencts and constants."
  textbook-section: "838"
- activity: "DataFlyer"
  reason: "With Data Flyer students plot a set of points and its function on a graph. This tool uses a slider to manipulate the function so as to view the effects of changes."
  textbook-section: "872"
- activity: "DataFlyer"
  reason: "This activity allows students to plot ordered pairs and a function on the same coordinate plane. The slider bar features allows manipulation of the function and see the changes. "
  textbook-section: "898"
- activity: "DataFlyer"
  reason: "Both the Graphit and Data Flyer activities have been recommended for use earlier in the text.  They both are graphing activities allowing graphing of a wide variety of functions on the coordinate plane as well as data sets.  Data Flyer allows more exploration with the use of slider bars to manipulate the equation and see the effects on the graph."
  textbook-section: "900"
- activity: "DataFlyer"

  textbook-section: "902"
- activity: "Estimator"
  reason: "In the \"Goose Problem\" presented in this section of the text, students are encouraged to use multiple representations and methods of estimation.  Teachers can encourage students to use a number of estimation strategies while using the Estimator activity but be aware that the \"hint\" button always gives the same type of hint by drawing a grid."
  textbook-section: "791"
- activity: "EstimatorFour"
  reason: "Estimator Four is similar to Estimator Quiz, except that students play a game.  This game involves two people, each playing to be the first to connect four of there own game pieces on the board in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  The players earn game pieces by correctly estimating addition, multiplication, and/or percentage problems.  This correlates to Section 1 because students can practice estimating multiplication and addition problems as done in the section, simply check only addition and multiplication.  Percentage could be an extra challenge if desired. "
  textbook-section: "786"
- activity: "EstimatorFour"
  reason: "When using either the Estimator Four and Estimator Quiz activities the user can choose percent estimation as the focus. Note though that even with the problem difficulty set on \"easy\", this one takes some skill. This should be a good challenge, especially with the higher difficulty levels, or shorter times. It applies all the skills of estimation as in the text."
  textbook-section: "855"
- activity: "FractionFinder"
  reason: "Students build fraction sense with the Fraction Finder activity allowing students to create fractions from circles and squares as well as associating these values with the number line."
  textbook-section: "808"
- activity: "FractionFinder"
  reason: "The Fraction Finder and Fraction Pointer activities, though quite similar to each other, can be used in conjunction to scaffold students' ability of working with fractions and finding fractions that fall in between two other fractions."
  textbook-section: "844"
- activity: "FractionPointer"
  reason: "The Fraction Finder and Fraction Pointer activities, though quite similar to each other, can be used in conjunction to scaffold students' ability of working with fractions and finding fractions that fall in between two other fractions."
  textbook-section: "844"
- activity: "FunctionFlyer"
  reason: "Similar to the Slope Slider and Data Flyer activities, Function Flyer allows students to graph a wide variety of functions and simultaneously change the graph and equation through the use of slider bars.  It is not a simple activity but still could be quite useful this late in the year with helping students to understand functions beyond just inputs and outputs."
  textbook-section: "902"
- activity: "GeneralCoordinates"
  reason: "This activity allows students to both plot a given point and enter a point to then place on the graph. This should be  useful for independent practice,  with another student or someone from home. "
  textbook-section: "825"
- activity: "GeneralCoordinates"
  reason: "Both the Maze Game and the General Coordinates Game activites provide good review and practice for students skills with plotting points on the coordinate plane."
  textbook-section: "833"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "Graphit is a nice challenge with understanding a function's graph. Students can get a good deal of practice and it aligns well with the problems in the book. Instruction will likely be needed on how to use the various inputs and outputs of the activity.  The help file will also be of assistance in understanding the activity's functionality. "
  textbook-section: "835"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "Graphit allows students to plot ordered pairs and functions on the same graph. This is a good tie-in, as well as possible extension, for this section of the text. This would also be a good chance for students to compare slope and what this means."
  textbook-section: "838"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "In Graphit, students plot ordered pairs and functions on the same coordinate plane. This should be a natural extension for the work in the textbook."
  textbook-section: "881"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "This activity was also recommended for use in the previous section so students may already be familiar with its use.  Although not tied directly to problems on slope, the equation portion of the exercises fits well with the activity."
  textbook-section: "882"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "Though recommended at a previous point in the text, this activity will work with this section of the text too as it ties to functions."
  textbook-section: "898"
- activity: "Graphit"

They both are graphing activities allowing graphing of a wide variety of functions on the coordinate plane as well as data sets. Data Flyer allows more exploration with the use of slider bars to manipulate the equation and see the effects on the graph."
  textbook-section: "900"
- activity: "Graphit"
  reason: "The Graphit and Data Flyer activities allow graphing of functions and data on the coordinate plane.  Data Flyer allows users to manipulate the graph and equation of the function through the use of slider bars."
  textbook-section: "902"
- activity: "Histogram"
  reason: "This activity presents several choices of data to use, as well as allows input of student's own data. Students would probably require teacher assistance to use this tool at this level.  However, even without the help, this one would have some independent use for the more advanced student."
  textbook-section: "853"
- activity: "Histogram"
  reason: "Students may specify data to be used in a histogram or rely on pre-made histogram data sets. The entry of data may take a little practice. "
  textbook-section: "870"
- activity: "Histogram"
  reason: "Students may specify data to be used in a histogram or rely on pre-made histogram data sets. The entry of data may take a little practice."
  textbook-section: "871"
- activity: "ImageTool"
  reason: "The Image Tool activity will allow students to explore some interesting applications of scale. As mentioned in the directions of the activity you can email Interactivate using the form at the bottom of the page and we will post requested images on the site (as long as they are not copyrighted!). "
  textbook-section: "819"
- activity: "ImageTool"
  reason: "The Image Tool can be used to work on scale, so there is a tie to this section and similar figures. However, the connection  will probably not be obvious without specific teacher guidance. It will give students a better intuitive feel for scale and proportion, an area that often needs additional practice at this level. "
  textbook-section: "851"
- activity: "ImageTool"
  reason: "Image Tool has some interesting uses for scale, such as aerial photos and maps. However, the textbook uses the concept of scale drawings in floor plans and models, which is not exactly how the activity is designed to work so the activity would be an extention or supplement the information provided through the text. There is one map question in the homework section of the text which would be a more direct tie. This activity could certainly have some good use as ideas for extensions and real world applications of scale."
  textbook-section: "897"
- activity: "KochSnowflake"
  reason: "Both the Sierpinski's Trainagle and Koch's Snowflake fractals can be used to demonstrate exponential change as well as connecting geometry to algebra."

- activity: "SquaringTheTriangle"
  reason: "Squaring the Triangle uses slider bars to adjust the lengths of legs for right triangles. Students can then observe the adjustments to the areas according to the figures at the bottom of the screen. This activity should help students explore the relationships of the Pythagorean Theorem in an easy, interesting, visual manner."
  textbook-section: "894"
- activity: "StemAndLeafPlotter"
  reason: "Stem and Leaf Plotter plots numerical data in the format of a stem and leaf plot.  Students can also practice finding the mean, median, and mode values, since these values are displayed along with the plot.

  textbook-section: "901"
- activity: "ExpProbability"
  reason: "This activity is a good review for this early in the year. If you choose dice for the experiment, two dice are used, as in the Difference Game from the text. It might be an interesting contrast to this game, since addition is used in the applet. The applet could be used for an extension for students to analyze the probabilities for addition with two dice as opposed to subtraction, for example. This activity is  basic, yet right on target for student needs at this point."
  textbook-section: "841"
