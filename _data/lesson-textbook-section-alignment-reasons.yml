- lesson: "PracticingArithmetic"
  reason: "The Practicing Arithmetic lesson provides students with the chance to practice a variety of types of problems, and then check with the Graph It activity. This is a different method than usual, and should be good for students this late in the year. This lesson helps take skills to higher level with a tie to algebra. This lesson could be made into a challenge if integers and decimal problems are included. A skills practice worksheet is provided with the lesson, if the teacher chooses to use it."
  textbook-section: "828"
- lesson: "PracticingArithmetic"
  reason: "Practicing Arithmetic does just that, with single operation problems. The teacher will need to come up with some practice problems for addition/subtraction of integers, as in the text. Graphit is the chosen activity withing the lesson, which will probably need some teacher guidance this early in the year. This one may not be for everyone just yet, but has application for some."
  textbook-section: "834"
- lesson: "PracticingArithmetic"
  reason: "This lesson gives students the opportunity to practice these operations in a different way. This lesson allows students to first work out a set of problems either chosen beforehand by the teacher, or selected from the lesson. Students can then use the Graphit activity to input their data sets and rules. In this way they can check for any solutions which are incorrect. The teacher will need to help get students started on this lesson, but it is worthwhile, especially for the students as this level. This tool ties algebra with skills practice."
  textbook-section: "875"
- lesson: "BoxPlots"
  reason: "This lesson is at the introductory level.  The discussions in the lesson explain the plots and how to find and interpret the various points of data.

  textbook-section: "841"
- lesson: "IntroProbability"
  reason: "This is another rather basic look at probability, but this lesson takes the students a little further into some investigations. It should be useful at this time in the text."
  textbook-section: "877"
- lesson: "IntroStatistics"
  reason: "Mean, Median and Mode discusses the idea of \"average\".  This is similar to how the terms mean, median, and mode are introduced in this section in the text.  This lesson also gives additional practice problems and involves the activity \"Measures\". "
