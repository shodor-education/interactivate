  After these discussions and activities, the students will have worked with condition probability
  and have seen the formula for the probability of simultaneous events. The next lesson,
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/ProbabilityToCombinatorics' | relative_url }}"> From Probability to Combinatorics and Number Theory</a> , is devoted to data structures and their applications to probability theory. Tables and trees
  are introduced, and some of their properties are discussed
