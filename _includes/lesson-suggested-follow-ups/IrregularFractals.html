  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen how complex fractals can be
  generated by generalizing the ideas for making regular fractals, introduced in the
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}">Geometric Fractals</a> and
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}">Fractals and Chaos Game</a> lessons. The next lesson,
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/TheMandelbrotSet' | relative_url }}">The Mandelbrot Set</a>, is a cap-stone activity, designed to introduce the student to the most celebrated modern fractal
  object, the Mandelbrot set.
