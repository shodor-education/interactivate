  This lesson introduced the notion of the normal curve and illustrated a real life (mis)use of the
  statistics drawn from a given situation. Revisiting the initial lessons on
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/StatisticsShopping' | relative_url }}">Statistics and Shopping</a> and
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/ProbabilityAndSports' | relative_url }}">Probability and Sports</a> and applying the new knowledge on statistics would make an excellent capstone activity.
