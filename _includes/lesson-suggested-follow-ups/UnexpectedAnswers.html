  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen more problems that explain
  what probability is, and be introduced to conditional probability. The next lesson,
  <a href="{{ '/lessons/IntroProbability' | relative_url }}">Introduction to the Concept of Probability</a>, further explains the concept of probability and the basic set operations that are useful in
  solving probability problems that involve counting outcomes.
