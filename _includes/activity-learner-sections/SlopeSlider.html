      This activity allows the user to explore the relationship between slope and intercept in the
      Cartesian coordinate system.

      The applet allows the manipulation of a linear function. The user may view the function in two
      forms: slope-intercept form, f(x) = mx + b, or standard notation, ax + by = c. There is a
      slider to change each coefficient and constant, so the user can manipulate the line and a
      point along the line.
