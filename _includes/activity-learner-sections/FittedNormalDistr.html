      This applet allows the user to experiment with randomly generated data sets at various sample
      sizes and standard deviations.

    <p>
      On the graph, the black curve and the Original Gaussian box show the expected mean, standard
      deviation, and amplitude values for the data set. When an experiment is done, the applet
      generates random numbers based on that distribution and then plots them on the same graph.
      Since these numbers are based on the original Gaussian, it is expected that the new
      distribution will be similar to the base distribution, but because the numbers are generated
      randomly, the new distribution will likely be slightly different.

      In the real world, this variability is an inescapable quality of nature - scientists rarely
      have access to the "original Gaussian" and so must attempt to figure it out from their samples
      alone. To do this, they often take multiple trials at large sample sizes, to minimize the
      effect of randomness. In this applet, for instance, the fitted Gaussian will usually look more
      similar to the original Gaussian with a sample size of 10000 than with a sample size of 100.

      This distribution was generated using a sample size of 100. As you can see, there is a very
      large degree of variability.

      much less variability.

    <p>
      Moreover, changing the standard deviation can also affect the variability of the sample. If
      your standard deviation is large, there will be more variability both in the individual
      numbers and in the fitted Gaussians as a whole. This means that scientists would require more
      experiments and larger sample sizes to accurately find the fitted Gaussian for highly variable
      real-world phenomena.
