      This activity allows the user to run a stopwatch on the computer screen. The stopwatch can
      either count from zero up or count down from a time specified by the user. While the stop
      watch is running, the user can press the record button to have the computer enter the current
      time in a list. The list can be used as a tool to collect data for experiments.
