      This activity allows the user to calculate the fractal dimension of a series of regular
      fractals without access to a calculator. It is not necessary to understand logs to use this
      activity. Calculation of fractal dimension is based upon the fact that Dimension, Scale and
      Number of similar copies in a geometric fractal follows the formula:
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image762.gif' | relative_url }}" /> For example, the Koch Snowflake
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image763.gif' | relative_url }}" /> is built from replacing a line segment with 4 segments each one third as long as the
      original, arranged as:
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image764.gif' | relative_url }}" /> The scale factor is 3 and the number of identical copies in the replacement is 4. Hence, we
      need to find D so that
      <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image765.gif' | relative_url }}" /> We can use either trial and error or logarithms to get the answer. In this case the dimension
      is about 1.262.
