  This applet allows the user to input a series of (x,y) ordered pairs and plot them 
  <em>in the order the pairs are inputted</em>. This allows the user to plot points so they are not necessarily a function. For inputting
  ordered pairs and graphing those pairs from the smallest x value to the largest, use 
  <a href="{{ '/activities/SimplePlot' | relative_url }}">Simple Plot</a>. Parameters such as minimum and maximum x value, minimum and maximum y value, and x- and
  y-scale can be set by the user or determined by the applet.

  The coordinate plane system was developed by a sick mathematician. As Rene Descarte lay in bed
  sick, he saw a fly buzzing around on the ceiling. His ceiling was made of square tiles. As he
  watched, he realized that he could describe the position of the fly by the ceiling tile it was
  on. After this experience, he developed the Cartesian coordinate system in the 17th century to
  help visualize functions via plotting function values as ordered pairs. In this system a grid
  of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines is drawn, a center or "origin" is chosen, and
  horizontal and vertical scales are chosen. Here's an example:
</p>
<p>
  <div class="h-center">
    <img src="{{ 'img/activities/learner/OrderedSimplePlot-learner-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  Notice that the horizontal and vertical scales are different, but each one considered alone is
  evenly spaced. Also, the blue point is labeled with its 
  <em>Cartesian coordinates</em>, the horizontal and vertical movement from the origin, in that order. This is the
  mathematical convention for naming points.
</p>
<p>
  Another name for the horizontal movement value is the 
  <em>abscissa</em>, and the vertical movement is the 
  <em>ordinate</em>. These terms are more rare now than they used to be, but you might still hear them being
  used.
