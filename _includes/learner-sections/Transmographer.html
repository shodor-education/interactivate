  This applet allows the user to explore the world of translations, reflections, and rotations.
  It allows the user to translate triangles, squares, and parallelograms on both the x and
  y-axes. The user can also reflect the figure around x values, y values, and the line x = y.
  The applet will also rotate the figure any given number of degrees.
