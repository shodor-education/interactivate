  This activity allows the user to plot points on the coordinate plane and to read the
  coordinates of a point plotted by the computer.

  The Cartesian coordinate system was formalized by Rene Descartes in the 17th century to help
  visualize functions via plotting function values as ordered pairs. The story of how the system
  was developed is that Descartes was sick. As Rene' Descarte lay in bed sick, he saw a fly
  buzzing around on the ceiling. His ceiling was made of square tiles. As he watched, he
  realized that he could describe the position of the fly by the ceiling tile he was on. After
  this experience, he developed the Cartesian coordinate system in the 17th century to help
  visualize functions via plotting function values as ordered pairs. In this system a grid of
  evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines is drawn, a center or "origin" is chosen, and
  horizontal and vertical scales are chosen. Here's an example: 
</p>
<p>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="{{ 'img/activities/learner/GeneralCoordinates-learner-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  Notice that the horizontal and vertical scales are different but each one considered alone is
  evenly spaced. Also, the blue point is labeled with its 
  <em>Cartesian coordinates</em>, the horizontal and vertical movement from the origin, in that order. This is the
  mathematical convention for naming points. 
</p>
<p>
  Another name for the horizontal movement value is the 
  <em>abscissa</em>, and the vertical movement is the 
  <em>ordinate</em>. These terms are more rare now than they used to be but you might still hear them being used.
