  This activity allows the user to plot ordered pairs and algebraic functions on the same
  coordinate plane. It combines the capabilities of

  The Cartesian coordinate system was formalized by Rene Descartes in the 17th century to help
  visualize functions via plotting function values as ordered pairs. In this system a grid of
  evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines is drawn, a center or "origin" is chosen, and
  horizontal and vertical scales are chosen. Here's an example: 
  <div class="h-center">
    <img src="{{ 'img/activities/learner/Graphit-learner-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
  </div> Notice that the horizontal and vertical scales are different, but each one considered alone
    is evenly spaced. Also, the blue point is labeled with its 
  <em>Cartesian coordinates,</em> the horizontal and vertical movement from the origin, in that order. This is the mathematical
  convention for naming points. 
</p>
<p>
  Another name for the horizontal movement value is the 
  <em>abscissa</em>, and the vertical movement is the 
  <em>ordinate</em>. These terms are more rare now than they used to be, but you might still hear them being
  used.
