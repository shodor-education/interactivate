      Functions are well defined if only one output can be assigned to each input. In other words,
      each x value (input) can have only one y value (output) associated with it. Graphically, this
      translates into a nice test for functions. The vertical line test states: If the curve graphed
      is a function, it will pass the vertical line test such that any vertical line drawn on the
      graph of a function will cross the function in at most one place.
