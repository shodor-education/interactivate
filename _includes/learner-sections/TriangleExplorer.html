  This applet allows users to study the nature of triangles and their area. It draws random
  triangles on a Cartesian coordinate system. The user can determine the area of the triangle
  using his or her preferred method. After the calculated area is entered into the input box,
  the applet will tell the user if s/he has the correct answer. Hints are available to help the
  user find the correct answer, if necessary.
