      This activity allows the user to practice solving algebraic equations.

      This activity is similar to Connect Four, and is designed for two players. The goal is to have
      four pieces of the same color connected either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. One
      player uses red pieces, while the other player uses blue pieces. To earn a piece, you need to
      correctly solve an algebraic equation.

      Solving an algebraic equation means finding the value of an unknown value in an equation that
      makes that equation true. For equations in the Algebra Four activity, you will be asked to
      find solutions to single variable equations.

      There are many ways to solve algebraic equations. Frequently, solving algebraic equations
      entails "isolating the variable" using relationships of equality and properties of real
      numbers such as the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/d' | relative_url }}">distributive property</a>, the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">associative property</a>, the
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/c' | relative_url }}">commutative property</a> and both
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/m' | relative_url }}">multiplicative inverses</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">additive inverses</a>.
    </p>

      Quadratic equations are also found in the Algebra Four game. An equation is considered
      "quadratic" when the variable is squared, such as x
      <sup> 2 </sup> =25. This type of equation often has two different answers that make the equation true, such
      as this one, x can be +5 or -5.
