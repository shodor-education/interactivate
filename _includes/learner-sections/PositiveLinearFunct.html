  This activity allows the user to explore simple linear functions; the function is determined
  by looking for patterns in the outputs. The functions available for exploration in the
  function machine activity have the following form: 
  <div class="center">
    <pre>
      y = __ * x + __
    </pre>
  </div>
</p>

  The notion of a function is important in higher mathematics such as calculus and in areas
  which use mathematics such as physics. Any rule that assigns exactly one output to an input or
  list of inputs can be called a function. 
</p>
<p>
  Here are a few examples: 
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Input the number of seconds after the starting gun in a race to get an output of the
      number of meters the runner has covered. 
      <table class="center">
        <tr>
          <th>
            Race Chart 
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Number of Seconds (input) 
          </td>
          <td>
            1 
          </td>
          <td>
            4 
          </td>
          <td>
            7 
          </td>
          <td>
            8 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Meters covered (output) 
          </td>
          <td>
            5 
          </td>
          <td>
            20 
          </td>
          <td>

          <td>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>y = x - 6</u>, where 
      <strong>x</u> is the place holder (also called a variable) for the input and 
      <strong>y</u> is the place holder for the output. 
      <table class="center">
        <tr>
          <th>
            Function y = x - 6 
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            X (input) 
          </td>
          <td>
            -3 
          </td>
          <td>
            0 
          </td>
          <td>

      The rule about only one output each time is crucial and must not be violated. For example,
      the table below cannot represent a function because 3 has two different outputs: 
      <table class="center">
        <tr>
          <th>
            Not a Function 
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            input 
          </td>
          <td>
            3 
          </td>
          <td>
            2 
          </td>
          <td>
            0 
          </td>
          <td>
            3 
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            output 
          </td>
          <td>
            4 
          </td>
          <td>
            -1 
          </td>
          <td>
            2 
          </td>
          <td>
            -3 
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The functions produced by this machine are special because they all graph as straight
      lines. In fact, the slope of the line and the y-intercept of the line are easy to read
      from the formula: 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center">
    <pre>
      y = (slope) * x + (y-intercept)
    </pre>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The slope tells us the rise over the run, and the intercept tells us where the line
      crosses the vertical axis when plotted: 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center">
    <img src="{{ 'img/activities/learner/PositiveLinearFunct-learner-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Here the red line has intercept = 7 and slope = -1/2, and the green line has intercept =
      -1 and slope = 4/2. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
