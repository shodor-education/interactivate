          Before you start the game, you can set several options. You can choose how much time each
          player will have to answer the questions. You can set the tolerance, which determines how
          close your answer must be to the actual answer to be counted correct. You can choose the
          problem difficulty (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3). You can also select the types of
          estimation problems you want to see. Once you have all the settings as you want them,
          click the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button.

        <li>
          After clicking the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button, a new screen appears. Towards the left of the screen is a table that lists the
          types of questions selected along with the difficulty level.

        </li>
        <li>
          Enter your answer into the answer textbox:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image721.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          After you have entered your answer, you need to click on the
          <img src="{{ 'img/image722.jpg' | relative_url }}"/> button to find out if you are correct. Since this is an
          <em>estimation</em> activity, your answer doesn't have to be exactly right. It can be either above or below
          the actual answer, as long as it is within the tolerance selected from the
          <strong>Answer must be</strong> menu in the starting screen.

        </li>
        <li>
          You have a limited amount of time to answer. The
          <strong>timer</strong> on the right-hand side of the board shows how much time you have left. Once the timer
          turns all gray, the time is up.
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1008.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to restart the game, you can do so by clicking on the
          <strong>New Game</strong> button:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image901.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
          To view the score, press the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
          To close this pop-up window press the
          <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
        </li>
        <li>
          To pause the scoring, press the
          <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
          <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
          <strong>Paused</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
          To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
          <strong>Reset</strong> button.
