          Before you start the quiz, you can set several options. You can choose how much time you
          will have to answer the questions, you can choose the problem difficulty (Whole Numbers
          Only, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3), and you can select the types of arithmetic problems you
          want to see. Once you have all of the settings as you want them, click the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button.

          questions will have at least one of these operations.

          Next, solve the arithmetic problem and enter your answer, rounded to three decimal places
          if necessary, into the answer textbox:

        <li>
          You have a limited amount of time to answer the question. The
          <strong>Elapsed Time</strong> above the answer textbox shows how much time has elapsed. Once the elapsed time reaches
          the amount you set before the game, the time is up.
