        The applet displays a random shape for you to calculate the area. Enter the area of the
        current shape into the
        <strong>What is the shape's area?</strong> text field and click the
        <strong>check answer</strong> button.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image255.gif' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        A message will appear beside the text field letting the user know whether or not the answer
        is correct.
      </li>
      <li>
        To get a new shape, click the
        <strong>Draw New Shape</strong> button.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image256.gif' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        To draw only rectangles, be sure the
        <strong>Only Draw Rectangular Shapes</strong> box is checked.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image257.gif' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are a couple of ways to change the perimeter of the figure. Either use the
        <strong>Adjust Perimeter</strong> scroll bar or type in a number in the text box and then click the
        <strong>Draw New Shape</strong> button. The maximum perimeter allowed is 50.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image258.gif' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The
          <strong>Compare Area and Perimeters</strong> button allows you to keep track of your previous correct answers in order to compare the
          corresponding areas to a given perimeter or vice versa. Clicking this button brings up a
          new window:
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image259.gif' | relative_url }}"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can sort the data in the comparison box by either the area or perimeter from least to
          greatest. To sort by area, make sure the
          <strong>area</strong> check box is selected and to sort by perimeter, make sure the
          <strong>perimeter</strong> check box is selected and then click the
          <strong>sort</strong> button.

          In order to return to the activity, simply click back in the main window (though if you
          are using Internet Explorer on OSX for Mac you will need to click on the title bar of the
          main window to return to the activity). To clear the data and keep the window open, click
          the
          <strong>clear</strong> button.

      <li>
        The
        <img src="{{ 'img/image988.png' | relative_url }}"/> button draws a red rectangular box around the figure on the grid. This can serve as a hint
        in determining the figure's perimeter. Note that once the button is clicked it toggles to
        read
        <img src="{{ 'img/image987.png' | relative_url }}"/> .
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image986.png' | relative_url }}"/>

      <strong>Scoring</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
        To view the score, press the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
        To close this pop-up window press the
        <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pause the scoring, press the
        <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
        <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
        <strong>Paused</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
        <strong>Reset</strong> button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this activity randomly generates questions, a feature called
      <strong>Seed Random</strong> has been implemented that allows multiple users using different computers to work on the same
      problem. See
      <a href="{{ '/resources/SeedRandom' | relative_url }}>Seed Random Help</a> for instructions on using this feature.
