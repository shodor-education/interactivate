      This activity requires you to perform four steps. First, you have to enter values for the two
      endpoint fractions, decimals, or percentages, with the smaller fraction, decimal, or
      percentage being entered first. The fractions and decimals must be greater than 0 and less
      than 1. Next, you create diagrams of the two entered endpoint fractions, decimals, or
      percentages by dividing a square or circle into equal parts and coloring in the appropriate
      areas. Then, you have to create a diagram of a third fraction, decimal, or percentage that is
      between the two endpoints. Finally, you have to give the name, in lowest terms, of your middle
      fraction, decimal, or percentage.
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can choose the game type by clicking one of the radio buttons next to
          <strong>Fraction</strong>,
          <strong>Decimal</strong>, or
          <strong>Percentage</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          First enter in the value of the Left (smaller) fraction, decimal, or percentage, using
          integers for the numerator and the denominator, two digits of precision for the decimal
          (or three digits if you wish to have a repeating decimal), or a percentage. Press the
          <strong>Set</strong> button, then enter the Right fraction, and press the
          <strong>Set</strong> button again.

        <li>
          You can choose from two different types of fraction, decimal, or percentage diagrams in
          the
          <strong>Choose Shape</strong> pull-down menu: square or circle. If you change shapes in the middle of a problem, all
          your work to that point will be lost.

          Below is an example of the square fraction diagram. You can change the number of columns
          by using the
          <strong>-Col</strong> button to remove columns and the
          <strong>+Col</strong> button to add columns. You can change the number of rows by using the
          <strong>+Row</strong> and
          <strong>-Row</strong> buttons. To color a section in the diagram, click the section. You can un-color a section
          by clicking it again.

        </li>
        <li>
          Below is an example of the circular fraction diagram. You can change the number of
          sections by using the
          <strong>+Sec</strong> button to add sections and the
          <strong>-Sec</strong> button to remove sections. To color a section in the diagram, click the section. You can
          un-color a section by clicking it again.

        </li>
        <li>
          For each of the two endpoint fractions, decimals, or percentages, you should make the
          colored part of the diagram equal to the corresponding fraction, decimal, or percentage.
          Then click the
          <strong>Check</strong> button for each diagram to check your answer. If the diagram is correct, the word
          "Correct" will be printed on top of the diagram; if it isn't correct, the word "Incorrect"
          will be printed instead. If your answer is incorrect, you can try again.
        </li>
        <li>
          After you correctly diagram the two endpoints, you will be asked to diagram a new
          fraction, decimal, or percentage between the endpoints. You can use any answer you want as
          long as it is between the two endpoints. When you think your answer is correctly colored
          and between the two endpoints, click the
          <strong>Check</strong> button to see if you are correct.
        </li>
        <li>
          After you correctly diagram the middle fraction, decimal, or percentage you will be asked
          to name it. In the indicated box, type the middle fraction in lowest terms, the middle
          decimal with two digits of precision, or the middle percentage, then click the
          <strong>Check</strong> button. If you wish to indicate a repeating decimal, use three digits of precision
          instead of two.

          At any time during the activity, you can click the
          <strong>Start Over</strong> button or the
          <strong>Next Question</strong> button. The
          <strong>Start Over</strong> button will restart the current question from the very beginning. The
          <strong>Next Question</strong> button will set up for a new question with new boundary values.

          This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
          To view the score, press the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
          To close this pop-up window press the
          <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.

          <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
          <strong>Paused</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
          To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
          <strong>Reset</strong> button.
