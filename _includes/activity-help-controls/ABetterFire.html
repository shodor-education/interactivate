          The
          <strong>Wind Control</strong> box on the left side of the applet has two portions in which you can manipulate - the
          <strong>Wind Direction Control</strong> and the
          <strong>Wind Speed Control.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Wind Direction Control</strong> compass, part of the
          <strong>Wind Control</strong> box, allows you to specify the direction in which the wind is blowing if there is any
          wind. Simply click in a portion of the circle to change the direction of the wind. For
          example, to have the wind blow south, click in the bottom-middle section of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Wind Speed Control</strong> panel, part of the
          <strong>Wind Control box</strong>, allows you to specify the intensity of the wind. It has three levels - light/calm winds
          (specified by the bar being green) which you can select by clicking on the lower 1/3
          portion of the bar; medium winds (specified by the bar turning yellow) which you can
          select by clicking on the middle 1/3 of the bar; and strong winds (specified by the bar
          turning red) which you can specify by clicking on the upper 1/3 of the bar. Light/calm
          winds do not modify the fire. Medium winds hasten the fire in the direction that the wind
          is blowing, and strong winds not only hasten the fire in the direction the wind is blowing
          more quickly, but actually stops the fire from spreading in the direction against the
          wind.

          The
          <strong>Forest Tree Density</strong> scrollbar, located to the right of the
          <strong>Wind Control box</strong>, allows you to specify the percentage of the next-generated forest that will be filled
          with trees. Sliding the bar all the way to the right will specify a forest 100% full of
          trees; sliding the bar all the way to the left will specify a forest 0% full of trees.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Size Buttons</strong>, located beneath the text "Size For Next Generated Forest," will allow you to specify the
          size of the next-generated forest.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Regrow Forest</strong> button will generate a forest based on the specifications you chose above.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Information Banner,</strong> located below the
          <strong>Regrow Forest</strong> button, will give you important information about what is going on with the forest
          currently.
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>Tree Burn</strong> output box will appear below the
          <strong>Information Banner</strong> after a fire has burned through the forest.
