          This activity is similar to Connect Four, and is designed for two players. The goal is to
          have four pieces of the same color connected either horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally. One player uses red pieces, while the other player uses black pieces.

          Before you start the game, you can set several options. You can choose how much time each
          player will have to answer the questions. You can set the tolerance, which determines how
          close your answer must be to the actual answer to be counted correct. You can choose the
          problem difficulty (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3). You can also select the types of
          estimation problems you want to see. Once you have all the settings as you want them,
          click the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button.

        </li>
        <li>
          After clicking the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button, a new screen appears. Towards the left of the screen is a table that lists the
          types of questions selected along with the difficulty level.
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1004.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          To earn a piece, you need to answer an estimation-related question. Enter your answer into
          the answer text box:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image721.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          After you have entered your answer, you need to click on the
          <img src="{{ 'img/image722.jpg' | relative_url }}"/> button to find out if you are correct. Since this is an
          <em>estimation</em> activity, your answer doesn't have to be exactly right. It can be either above or below
          the actual answer, as long as it is within the tolerance selected from the
          <strong>Answer must be</strong> menu in the starting screen.
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1003.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>timer</strong> on the right-hand side of the board shows how much time you have left to answer. Once the
          timer turns all gray, the time is up. If you chose "No Time Limit," the timer will simply
          be gray, and it will not count down.
          <img src="{{ 'img/image723.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player answers a question correctly, that player will be able to place a piece on the
          board. To place a piece, simply click on the column that you want to drop the piece into.
          The piece will fall into the lowest available slot in the column.

        </li>
        <li>
          If a player answers incorrectly, the correct answer will be displayed in a pop-up window
          and then the other player will be asked a new question. No one will place a piece on the
          board if a question is answered incorrectly.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to restart the game or change options selected on the beginning screen, you
          can do so by clicking on the
          <strong>New Game</strong> button:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image274.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          To change the font size of the question displayed you can, at any time during game play,
          select one of the three radio buttons on the left side of the screen:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1000.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
          To view the score, press the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
          To close this pop-up window press the
          <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
        </li>
        <li>
          To pause the scoring, press the
          <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
          <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
          <strong>Paused</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
          To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
          <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
          <strong>Reset</strong> button.
        </li>
