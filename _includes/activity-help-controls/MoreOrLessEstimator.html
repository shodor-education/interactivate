        This activity asks you to make three different types of estimations: counting, length, and
        area. In the center of the activity there is a picture. For counting problems, the picture
        shows a group of objects and you have to estimate whether the number of objects is greater
        than or less than a specified number. For length problems, the picture shows a curve and you
        have to estimate whether the curve's length is greater than or less than a specified number.
        For area problems, the picture shows a shape and you have to estimate whether the shape's
        area is greater than or less than a specified number.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the problem is a length or area problem, you will be given a scale in the upper
        left-hand part of the picture. The length scale looks like this:
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image708.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          This tells you that the length of the line on the screen is equal to 2 units. You should
          use these units to estimate the length of the curve. The area scale looks like this:
          <div>
            <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image709.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells you that the area of the square on the screen is equal to 1 square unit. You
          should use these units to estimate the area of the shape.
        </p>
      </li>

        To answer a question, choose the correct phrase from the pull-down menu. Your choices are
        "greater than" or "less than" (the quantity shown in the picture will never be exactly the
        same as the number). After you choose your answer, click the
        <strong>Check Answer</strong> button to see if your answer was correct.
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image710.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need help, click the
        <strong>Hint</strong> button. This will display a grid over the picture. You can use this grid as an aid to your
        estimation.
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image711.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        To go to the next problem, click the
        <strong>Next Problem</strong> button:
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image712.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can set the type of problems you see by picking a problem from the
        <strong>Problem Type</strong> pull-down menu. If you choose "Random," the activity will give you random problems that may
        be counting, length, or area problems. If you choose any of the other three options, you
        will only get problems of that type.
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image713.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose from two levels: level 1 and level 2.
        <div>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image1046.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </div>
      </li>

        This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
        To view the score, press the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
        To close this pop-up window press the
        <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pause the scoring, press the
        <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
        <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
        <strong>Paused</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
        <strong>Reset</strong> button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this activity randomly generates questions, a feature called
      <strong>Seed Random</strong> has been implemented that allows multiple users using different computers to work on the same
      problem. See
      <a href="{{ '/resources/SeedRandom' | relative_url }}>Seed Random Help</a> for instructions on using this feature.
