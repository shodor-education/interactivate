<ul>
      <li>
        The program provides an illustration of two parallel lines. You can choose whether the lines
        are cut by one or two transversals.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image276.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        Examine the given information that appears below the drawing. It displays the measure of one
        of the angles in the diagram and gives which lines are parallel to each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program will ask you to identify two angles as either obtuse, acute, or right. Use the
        pull-down choices to answer:
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image277.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        The program then asks that you specify a relationship between the two angles. Once again,
        use the pull-down choices to choose either vertical, adjacent, alternate-interior,
        alternate-exterior, same-side interior, same-side exterior, corresponding, or none of the
        above:
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image278.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        After you believe you have correctly identified the three answers, click the
        <strong>Check Answer</strong> button to see if you are correct:
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image279.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to get a new question, click the
        <strong>New Angles</strong> button:
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image280.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
        To view the score, press the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
        To close this pop-up window press the
        <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pause the scoring, press the
        <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
        <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
        <strong>Paused</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
        <strong>Reset</strong> button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this activity randomly generates questions, a feature called
      <strong>Seed Random</strong> has been implemented that allows multiple users using different computers to work on the same
      problem. See
      <a href="{{ '/resources/SeedRandom' | relative_url }}>Seed Random Help</a> for instructions on using this feature.
