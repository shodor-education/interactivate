        <li>
          At the top of the activity, a phrase is displayed that you need to decode:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image820.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          Below the phrase that you have to decode are three text fields for you to enter your
          guesses for the multiplier, constant, and the decoded phrase. The
          <strong> multiplier </strong> is the number that is multiplied by the number value of each letter in your text, and the
          <strong> constant </strong> is the number that is added to this product of the number value of each letter and the
          multiplier.
          <img src="{{ 'img/image821.jpg' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          After you have entered your "guesses", pressing the
          <strong>Check your answers!</strong> button will let you know which are correct and which are incorrect.
