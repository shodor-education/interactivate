          The
          <strong>Equation</strong> area is for entering equations for x and y. To graph parametric equations, type the
          equation for x and y in the text boxes next to
          <strong>x=</strong> and
          <strong>y=</strong> respectively. Make sure the equations are a function of t since parametric equations are
          graphed with respect to time. You may graph up to four equations on the same plot. Enter
          one formula per line, as shown.

          The
          <strong>Data</strong> area is for entering data points. Data points should be in the form (x,y). Parentheses
          around the data point are optional. A tab or a space can separate the x and the y though
          no space is needed. A space or a carriage return is required to separate the data points
          from one another. After you input the coordinates, you must press the
          <strong>Plot/Update</strong> button to graph them.

          You can plot a total of four pairs of equations at once. You can also plot a total of

          Separate data sets by typing
          <strong>newgraph</strong> on a line by itself in the
          <strong>Data</strong> window. If you want to specify your own colors for the graphs you can replace
          <strong>newgraph</strong> with the following keywords:

          <strong>X min</strong> and
          <strong>X max</strong> are the minimum and maximum x-values displayed on the graph. Similarly,
          <strong>Y min</strong> and
          <strong>Y max</strong> are the minimum and maximum y-values.
          <strong>X scale</strong> and
          <strong>Y scale</strong> are the distances between vertical and horizontal gridlines. If you choose
          <strong>Choose Scale Automatically</strong>, a reasonable scale will be chosen for you, otherwise you can uncheck the box and select
          your own scale. If at anytime you want to restore the default window, click on the

        <li>
          The t values in the table increment equally and then give the corresponding x(t) and y(t)
          values for each equation plotted. You can change these data values by entering a new
          minimum t value, new maximum t value, and step size. If you enter a step that does not
          divide evenly into the range, the table will stop at the greatest multiple of the step
          that is less than the maximum. The precision field allows you to adjust the number of
          decimal points displayed.
