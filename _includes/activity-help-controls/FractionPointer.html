      This activity requires you to perform three steps. First, you have to create diagrams of two
      given endpoint fractions, decimals, or percentages by dividing a square or circle into equal
      parts and coloring in the appropriate areas. Then, you have to create a diagram of a third
      fraction, decimal, or percentage that is between the two endpoints; the third pointer will
      help you find it. Finally, you have to give the name, in lowest terms, of your middle
      fraction, decimal, or percentage.

        You can choose the game type by clicking one of the radio buttons next to
        <strong>Fraction</strong>,
        <strong>Decimal</strong>, or
        <strong>Percentage</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose from two different types of diagrams in the
        <strong>Choose Shape</strong> pull-down menu: square or circle. If you change shapes in the middle of a problem, all your
        work to that point will be lost.

        Below is an example of the square fraction diagram. You can change the number of columns by
        using the
        <strong>-Col</strong> button to remove columns and the
        <strong>+Col</strong> button to add columns. You can change the number of rows by using the
        <strong>+Row</strong> and
        <strong>-Row</strong> buttons. To color a section in the diagram, click the section. You can un-color a section
        by clicking it again.

        Below is an example of the circular fraction diagram. You can change the number of sections
        by using the
        <strong>+Sec</strong> button to add sections and the
        <strong>-Sec</strong> button to remove sections. To color a section in the diagram, click the section. You can
        un-color a section by clicking it again.

        For each of the two endpoint fractions, decimals, or percentages you should make the colored
        part of the diagram equal to the corresponding fraction, decimal, or percentage. Then click
        the
        <strong>Check</strong> button for each diagram to check your answer. If the diagram is correct, the word "Correct"
        will be printed on top of the diagram; if it isn't correct, the word "Incorrect" will be
        printed instead. If your answer is incorrect, you can try again.
      </li>
      <li>
        After you correctly diagram the two endpoints, you will be asked to diagram a new fraction,
        decimal, or percentage between the endpoints. You can use any answer you want as long as it
        is between the two endpoints. As you create the new diagram, the arrow at the bottom of your
        diagram will move so you can tell when you are between the two endpoints. When you think
        your middle answer is correctly colored and between the two endpoints, click the
        <strong>Check</strong> button to see if you are correct.
      </li>
      <li>
        After you correctly create the middle diagram, you will be asked to name the middle
        fraction, decimal, or percentage. In the indicated box, type the middle fraction in lowest
        terms, the middle decimal with two digits of precision, or the middle percentage. If you
        wish to indicate a repeating decimal, use three digits of precision instead of two. Then
        click the
        <strong>Check</strong> button.

        At any time during the activity, you can click the
        <strong>Start Over</strong> button or the
        <strong>Next Question</strong> button. The
        <strong>Start Over</strong> button will restart the current question from the very beginning. The
        <strong>Next Question</strong> button will get a new question.

        This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
        To view the score, press the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
        The information in this window is divided into two sections. The statistics for the current
        question are given in the top half of the window, and the statistics for all questions
        together are given in the bottom half. To close this pop-up window press the
        <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.

        To pause the scoring, press the
        <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
        <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
        <strong>Paused</strong> button.
