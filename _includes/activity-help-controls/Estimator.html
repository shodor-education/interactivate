        This activity asks you to make three different types of estimations: counting, length, and
        area. In the center of the activity there is a picture. For counting problems, the picture
        shows a group of objects and you have to estimate how many there are. For length problems,
        the picture shows a curve and you have to estimate how long the curve is. For area problems,
        the picture shows a shape and you have to estimate the area of the shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the problem is a length or area problem, you will be given a scale in the upper
          left-hand part of the picture. The length scale looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image708.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells you that the length of the line on the screen is equal to 2 units. You should
          use these units to estimate the length of the curve. The area scale looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image709.jpg' | relative_url }}"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          This tells you that the area of the square on the screen is equal to 1 square unit. You
          should use these units to estimate the area of the shape.
        </p>

        To answer a question, type your answer in the box next to the question. Then click the
        <strong>Check Answer</strong> button to see if your answer was correct. Since this is an estimation activity, your answer
        does not have to be absolutely correct. It just has to be "close enough" to the real answer.
        If you answer is not correct, a message just above the picture will tell you if your answer
        is too high or too low.

      </li>
      <li>
        If you need help, click the
        <strong>Hint</strong> button. This will display a grid over the picture. You can use this grid as an aid to your
        estimation.

      </li>
      <li>
        To go to the next problem, click the
        <strong>Next Problem</strong> button:

      </li>
      <li>
        There are several settings you can control in this activity. You can set the type of
        problems you see by picking a problem from the
        <strong>Problem Type</strong> pull-down menu. If you choose "Random," the activity will give you random problems that may
        be counting, length, or area problems. If you choose any of the other three options, you
        will only get problems of that type.

      <li>
        You can choose from two difficulties: Level 1 or Level 2.
        <img class="h-center" src="{{ 'img/image1042.JPG' | relative_url }}"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the menu beside the words
        <strong>Answer must be</strong>, you can choose how close your answer must be to the real answer to be counted correct. If
        you choose "Almost perfect," your answer must be within 5% (either above or below) of the
        actual answer. If you choose "Really close," your answer must be within 10%. If you choose
        "Close," your answer must be within 15%.

      </li>
      <li>
        The
        <strong>Show History</strong> button allows you to keep track of your previous guesses on a particular problem. You can
        use this information to narrow down the range of numbers to determine a correct estimate.
        When an estimate is made within the correct range the exact answer appears in the third
        column.

        This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
        To view the score, press the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button at the bottom of the activity and a pop-up window will appear with the scoreboard.
        To close this pop-up window press the
        <strong>Close</strong> button or click back on the main window.
      </li>
      <li>
        To pause the scoring, press the
        <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
        <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
        <strong>Paused</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        To reset the scoreboard, open the scoreboard using the
        <strong>Show Score</strong> button and then press the
        <strong>Reset</strong> button.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this activity randomly generates questions, a feature called
      <strong>Seed Random</strong> has been implemented that allows multiple users using different computers to work on the same
      problem. See
      <a href="{{ '/resources/SeedRandom' | relative_url }}">Seed Random Help</a> for instructions on using this feature.
