      This activity allows the user to generate cross sections of a variety of solids by using radio
      buttons and slider bars to select the solid type, the solid size, and the position of the
      slice. The outline of each cross section is plotted on the graph as it is formed.

      On the left of the page there is the default shape which is the double cone. On the right side
      of the page there is a graph which has the default cross section of an ellipse.

      <em>Zoom/Pan buttons</em>. In the upper right corner of the graph, there are three buttons with pictures of magnifying
      glasses. From top to bottom these buttons represent zoom in, zoom out, and pan, respectively.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To zoom in, click the top button to depress it, then click and drag over the area of the
          graph that you wish to magnify. The images below show first the process of dragging a box
          around a desired zoom area with the mouse (left), and then the resulting zoomed image
          after the mouse button is released (right). Note that after the zoom-in has been
          performed, the zoom-in button at top right is no longer depressed.

        </li>
        <li>
          To zoom out, simply click the second of the three zoom buttons. The graph will
          automatically zoom out by doubling the min and max values of the axes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          To use the pan feature, click the bottom magnifying glass button to depress it. Click and
          drag over the graph and the graph will pan around according to the movement of the mouse.
          Upon releasing the mouse, the pan button is released.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      To change the viewing angle of the solid, the user may click and drag on the solid.

    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose to
      <strong>reset view</strong> or
      <strong>reset graph</strong> by clicking on their corresponding buttons beneath the viewing area. Each button will cause
      the view or the graph to reset to its starting position. It will not reset the cross-section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The check box below the solid can be used to identify the type of cross section that is
      generated by the slice. When the box is unchecked, no identification will appear. When it is
      checked, the user will see the name of the cross section, such as circle, ellipse, hyperbola,
      parabola, pentagon, and others.

      The user may select the type of solid desired by using the radio buttons at the lower left
      side of the page.

          The double cone is a three-dimensional figure which has two cones connecting at their
          vertices.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The cone is a three-dimensional figure whose base is a circle and whose sides are formed
          by rotating a right triangle about its leg which is placed at the center of and
          perpendicular to the circle. The point at the top of the cone is called its vertex.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The cylinder is three-dimensional figure with two circular bases which are parallel and
          congruent.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The pyramid is a three-dimensional figure that has a regular polygon as its base and
          triangular sides with a common vertex. In a regular polygon, all sides are equal in
          length. The number of sides in the base can vary from 3 to 12.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The prism is a three-dimensional figure having two congruent, parallel bases that are
          regular polygons and lateral faces that are rectangles. The number of sides in the base
          can vary from 3 to 12.
          <br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The user can use the slider bars to rotate the slice (around the y-axis or the z-axis), move
      the slice up or down, or change the dimensions of the solid. If the solid is a double cone,
      cone or cylinder, the radius slider bar will change the radius of the circular base.

    </p>
    <p>
      If the solid is a pyramid or prism, the lateral faces slider bar can be used to increase or
      decrease the number of sides in the base of the solid. This also changes the number of lateral
      faces.
      <img src="{{ 'img/crosssection12.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      The animate button at the end of each slider bar may be used to automatically move the slider
      between its endpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user can choose how the cross-section will be displayed graphically, by choosing how the
      axes of the graph are determined. By clicking on the radio buttons at the bottom of the
      applet, the user can choose to center axes on the point nearest to origin, the focus of the
      conic section (only when working with the cone, double cone, or cylinder), or the centroid of
      the cross-section.

    <p>
      The user can also choose to have no grid lines on the graph, light grid lines, or dark grid
      lines.
