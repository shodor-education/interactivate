          This activity is similar to Connect Four, and is designed for two players. The goal is to
          have four pieces of the same color connected either horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally. One player uses red pieces, while the other player uses black pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Before you start the game, you can set several options. You can choose how much time each
          player will have to answer the questions. You can choose the problem difficulty (Level 1,
          Level 2, Level 3). You can also select the types of fraction problems you want to see.
          Once you have all the settings as you want them, click the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button.

        </li>
        <li>
          After clicking the
          <strong>Start Game</strong> button, a new screen appears to play the game. Towards the left of the screen is a table
          that lists the types of questions selected along with the difficulty level.

        </li>
        <li>
          To earn a piece, you need to answer a fraction-related question. Enter your answer into
          the answer text box:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image693.gif' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that within the input field there is a pattern (#### or #/#) which indicates whether
          your answer should be a decimal or a fraction. If your answer is a decimal, it must be
          accurate to within .001. (For instance, if the correct answer is one-third as a decimal
          then .33 will not be accepted but .333 will).
        </li>
        <li>
          The
          <strong>timer</strong> on the right-hand side of the board shows how much time you have left to answer. Once the
          timer turns all gray, the time is up. If you chose "No Time Limit," the timer will simply
          be gray, and it will not count down.

        </li>
        <li>
          After you have entered your answer, you need to click on the
          <strong>Answer</strong> button to find out if you are correct.

        <li>
          If a player answers a question correctly, the player will be able to place one of their
          pieces on the board. To place a piece, simply click on the column that you want to drop
          the piece into.
          <strong>The piece will fall into the lowest available slot in the column.</strong> If a player answers incorrectly or if time runs out, the other player will have a chance
          to answer. If neither player is correct the answer appears in a pop-up window.

        </li>
        <li>
          If a player -- player Red for instance -- answers incorrectly, the other player -- Player
          Black -- will be asked to answer the question. If Black also answers incorrectly, the
          answer will be displayed in a pop-up window and the game will continue with a new question
          for Black. Note that whether or not player Black answers correctly, it will be Black's
          turn again, because Black just attempted Red's question.
        </li>

          If you want to restart the game or change options selected on the beginning screen, you

        <li>
          To change the font size of the question displayed you can, at any time during game play,
          select one of the three radio buttons on the left side of the screen:
          <img src="{{ 'img/image1000.png' | relative_url }}" class="h-center"/>

        <li>
          This activity will automatically record how successful you are at answering the questions.
          To view the score, press the

          <strong>Active</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and it will change to a
          <strong>Paused</strong> button. To resume scoring, press the
          <strong>Paused</strong> button.
