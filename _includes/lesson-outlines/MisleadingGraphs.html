    </li>
    <li>
      Explain the term misleading graph
    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about how graphs can sometimes be misleading.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to make our own graphs and learn how to analyze and compare
      those graphs, but please do not turn your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you
      a little about these activities first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  Demonstrate how to use the
  <a href="{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}">Bar Graph</a> and
  <a href="{{ '/activities/Histogram' | relative_url }}">Histogram</a> applets.
</p>
<p />
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  Allow time for the students to familiarize themselves with the applets while you circulate
  throughout the room answering any questions.
</p>
<p />
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students turn off their monitor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Explain to the students their assignment and following the explanation have students
        construct their catchers:
      </p>
      <p>
        You are to work in pairs to construct a water balloon catcher. You have been alloted X
        amount of dollars to purchase supplies. (Have a store set up in the rear of the room.
        Materials can consist of almost any type of scrap you can collect from around the school,
        your home, or that your students collect and donate.) After these water balloon catchers are
        complete we will test them as a class. Each group will have the opportunity to drop 10 water
        balloons into their catcher in order to collect data on their group's catcher and their
        competitor's catchers based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How many water balloons landed in the catcher?
        </li>
        <li>
          How many water balloons completely missed the catcher?
        </li>
        <li>
          How many water balloons dropped into the catcher and bounced out?
        </li>
        <li>
          Total number of balloons the catcher will hold at any given time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Did the catcher require any maintenance?
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of broken balloons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Number of balloons caught without breaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cost of balloon catcher.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total cost of balloon catcher including maintenance fees.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once all the data has been collected you will design a commercial enticing people to
        purchase your water balloon catcher over your competitor's. You will need to include at
        least two graphs in your commercial. (These graphs can be misleading but are not required to
        be.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        After students construct their water balloon catchers, they should collect data on the
        <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/218.pdf' | relative_url }}">data sheet</a> as a class.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the data has been collected,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Have the students design their graphs using the
          <a href="{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}">Bar Graph</a> and/or the
          <a href="{{ '/activities/Histogram' | relative_url }}">Histogram</a> applets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have students design their commercials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have each group preform their commercial in front of the class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have all the competing groups vote on which water balloon catcher they would buy based on
          the commercials (excluding their own).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Select a few of the commercials to discuss.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss the graphs contained in the chosen commercials and why they may or may not be
      misleading.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p />
