<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After the class is seated, ask them to follow along with what you are about to do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Begin rotating between patting your legs and clapping your hands: pat, clap, pat, clap, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the entire class is following along, ask someone to raise their hand and tell the class
      how they knew what to do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students if anyone else has a different answer. The answer you are looking for will
      contain the word "pattern".
    </li>
    <li>
      Tell the students to join in and follow along as soon as they know what you are doing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Begin: clap, pat, tap (on a desk), clap, pat, tap, clap, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the entire class is following along, ask someone to raise his/her hand and tell the class
      how they knew what to do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students if anyone else has any different answers. The answer you are looking for will
      contain the word "pattern".
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue this process making the pattern increasingly more difficult to decipher each time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Students will be able to recognize patterns and fill in missing segments of patterns.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the students have not already mentioned the word "pattern", tell them that the exercise
      they just finished contained various patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the class if anyone can come up with a different type of pattern that doesn't involve
      movement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call several students to the front of the class and have them share the beginning of their
      patterns with the class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the class if anyone can complete the patterns provided by their classmates.
    </li>
    <li>
      If none of the students think of any shape patterns place a few of them on the board and have
      the students complete the patterns.
      <div class="h-center">
        <img src="{{ 'img/lessons/RecognizingPatterns-lesson-1.gif' | relative_url }}" />
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Be sure to ask questions about each pattern.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does anyone see a pattern?
        </li>
        <li>
          What pattern do you see?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there more than one possible pattern?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instruct the students to spend about 3-5 minutes playing with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tessellate' | relative_url }}">Tessellations</a> applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      After they have had a few minutes to become familiar with the applet, ask if anyone knows what
      the applet is doing.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Did anyone notice any patterns created by the applet?
        </li>
        <li>
          What patterns did you see?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students take out a sheet of paper, extend the following number sequences, and
      explain how they determined the subsequent numbers in the sequences. You may want to do the
      first one with the students.
      <ul>
        <li>
          0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...
        </li>
        <li>
          0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ...
        </li>
        <li>
          0, 10, 20, 30, 40...
        </li>
        <li>
          1, 3, 9, 27, 81... (# * 3)
        </li>
        <li>
          0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31... (# * 2 + 1)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Are these patterns? Why
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students open the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/PatternGenerator' | relative_url }}">Patterns</a> applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Direct the students to complete the sequences provided. You may want to have the students copy
      a few lines of the computer generated patterns to ensure each student is on task.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now, instruct the students to open the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Sequencer' | relative_url }}">Sequencer</a> applet, and have them begin creating new sequences using the applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the students have created their sequences, have them swap the number sequences with a
      partner, and instruct their partners to utilize the sequencer applet to help them decipher the
      sequence patterns.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Discuss patterns and their occurrences in nature, society, school, and math.
    </li>
    <li>
      Answer any remaining questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
