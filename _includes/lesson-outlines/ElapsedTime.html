<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Open the lesson with this question, replacing times to make it more authentic:
  <ul>
    <li>
      We started math at 10 a.m. It is now 11 a.m. How long have we been doing math?
    </li>
    <li>
      What do we call this time?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn what elapsed time is and how to calculate it.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to do this but please do not turn your computers on until I
      ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead the students in a
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ElapsedTime' | relative_url }}">discussion</a> about elapsed time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students draw starting and ending times on their
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/249.pdf' | relative_url }}">Elapsed Time Record Sheet</a>. Then instruct them to calculate the elapsed time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open your browser to the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/ElapsedTime' | relative_url }}">Elapsed Time</a> applet. Explain to the students how to work the applet.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students answer 10 problems on their own.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students answer the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/475.pdf' | relative_url }}">Exploration Questions</a> while working with the applet.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Discuss as a class what the students discovered while answering the exploration questions.
    </li>
