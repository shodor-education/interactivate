<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Has anyone ever heard of M. C. Escher? (Escher was a famous artist who enjoyed twisting
      perceptions of reality. He was responsible for works such as Reptiles, Horseman and many more
      that incorporated the use of tessellations.)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about tellellations.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about tessellations, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Introduce the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tessellate' | relative_url }}">t=Tessellation Applet</a> in order to familiarize students to the idea of tessellations and how they developed.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students explore which regular polygons tessellate and why. Start them by examining
      tessellations of regular polygons including number of sides and interior angle measurements by
      using a
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/174.pdf' | relative_url }}">data table</a> . Encourage students to determine a pattern among the polygons that they tessellate. Ask the
      students to predict which regular polygons will and will not tessellate and why. Follow-up by
      having the students write a concise definition for a regular polygon tessellation. Have them
      expand this definition to describe a tessellation made from non-regular polygons.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the students have determined which regular polygons tessellate,
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/SymmetryInTessellati' | relative_url }}">discuss</a> the types of symmetry present in tessellations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students build tessellations and identify the types of symmetry present. Give them a
      table to record the basic shape used to tile and the types of symmetry present in the basic
      unit and in the tessellated pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss how angle measure, area, and perimeter apply to tessellations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow students time to practice their knowledge about tessellations. Have teams of students
      work together. Instruct one student on the team to create a tessellation. Have that student
      describe the tessellation to other students and see if the other students can recreate the
      tessellation without looking. The students should formalize their terminology and describe the
      tessellation in terms of angle measure, polygon shape, symmetry, area and perimeter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead a
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/TessellationsWorld' | relative_url }}">discussion</a> about tessellations in the world. Ask students to identify tessellations that they see in
      their daily lives and in nature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss the ways that we perceive patterns. Lead a discussion about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/OpticalIllusions' | relative_url }}">optical illusions</a> to demonstrate how we perceive patterns. Also discuss the use of
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ColorTessellations' | relative_url }}">color in tessellations</a>. Suggest that the students change the colors in their tessellations to see what effect that
      has on how they perceive the pattern. They may want to record their observations in a journal.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask the students to use the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Tessellate' | relative_url }}">Tessellation Activity</a> to build tessellations of patterns they see in art and nature. You may also ask students to
      stretch the regular polygons into the letters of the alphabet or the letters of their name and
      tessellate the pattern. Have them record which polygon is best used to shape each letter. Also
      have them record what type of symmetries are present in each tessellation.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
