<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Review vocabulary</li>
  		<li>Tell the students that today they will be learning about fractions</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  		Students will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of fractions through the use of manipulatives and computer applets. </p><p>
  	</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Have the students participate in the <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/219.pdf' | relative_url }}">King Fraction</a>  scenario.</li>
  		<li>Pass 50 blocks or small square similarly sized pieces of paper to each student.</li>
  		<li>Students should work in pairs.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Instruct partner A to place 30 of his/her blocks in 5 equal piles and to ignore the rest of his/her blocks. Instruct partner B to place 30 of his/her blocks into 3 equal piles and to ignore the rest.</li>
  		<li>Once all the students have their blocks grouped properly ask them the total number of blocks each person placed in groups.</li>
  		<li>Begin asking the students questions like:
  		<ul>
  		<li>What number of blocks is equal to 3/5 of 30?</li>
  		<li>What number of blocks is equal to 1/5 of 30?</li>
  		<li>What number of blocks is equal to 4/5 of 30?</li>
  		</ul>
  		</li>
  		<li>Once the students no longer have difficulty with this activity begin asking them questions like:
  		<ul>
  		<li>What is 3/4 of 24?</li>
  		<li>What is 1/6 of 24?</li>
  		<li>What is 2/8 of 48?</li>
  		</ul>
  		</li>
  		<li>Have the students arrange their blocks to calculate the answer to each of the above questions.</li>
  		<li>Walk around the class spot checking the students blocks.</li>
  		<li>Once the students no longer have difficulty with this activity begin asking them questions like:
  		<ul>
  		<li>Which fraction is larger 3/5 or 8/10?
  		<p><em>Be sure to mention when the students answer these questions they need to be using the same number of blocks to calculate the fractions from each question. You may also want to work through the first question as a class.</em></p><p><em>
  		For example: Have the students arrange 2 sets of 10 blocks. Have them arrange the first set into 10 equal groups and the other set into 5 equal groups. Finally have them compare 3/5 of 10 to 8/10 of 10 and tell you which one is larger.</em></p></li>
  		<li>Which fraction is larger 2/3 or 3/9?</li>
  		<li>Which fraction is larger 1/2 or 1/5?</li>
  		</ul>
  		</li>
  		<li>Have the students open the <a href="{{ '/activities/FractionFinder' | relative_url }}">Fraction Finder</a>  applet.</li>
  		<li>Walk the students through 1 or 2 of the computer generated problems.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Have the students work in pairs taking turns with the  <a href="{{ '/activities/FractionFinder' | relative_url }}">Fraction Finder</a> applet.</li>
  		<li>You may or may not want to have the students draw and label each of their computer generated problems so that you can have something written to check.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Review pertinent vocabulary such as: fraction, denominator, and numerator</li>
  		<li>Review what each of the different parts of a fraction represent.</li>
  		<li>Review that fractions can be part of 1 whole object or part of a number of objects.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>
</li>
