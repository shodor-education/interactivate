<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Remind students of what they learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson.
</p>
<p />
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we will learn how to use division to solve probability problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to help us, but please do not turn your computers on until I
      ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Explain the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/RacingGameWithTwoDie' | relative_url }}">Racing Game with Two Dice</a> , which will introduce the concept of data structures and computing particular probabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students begin with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/RacingGameWithTwoDie' | relative_url }}">Racing Game with Two Dice</a> Several players "race to the finish" using the software or on paper. For every round, each
      player makes either one or two steps depending on the outcome of the roll of two dice. Each
      group of students can come up with its own way of randomly choosing which players make one or
      two steps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead a discussion based on
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/TablesAndCombinatori' | relative_url }}">Tables and Combinatorics</a>, discussing tables as data structures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a discussion about
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/Divisibility' | relative_url }}">divisibility</a> as it can be used in probability. The discussion is based on the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/DiceTable' | relative_url }}">Dice Table</a> activity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead the discussion:
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/TreesAsDataStructure' | relative_url }}">Tree as a data structure</a>. This discussion introduces and develops the idea of trees as data structures. It is based on
      all the other parts of the lesson. Plan it as a "live" discussion where students have an
      opportunity to ask their own questions, because the topic tends to be interesting to many
      people and it can lead to various investigations in math and computer science.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work alone or in small groups and play the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/DiceTable' | relative_url }}">Dice Table</a> activity, where students research tables as data structures and use tables to count outcomes
      and compute probabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
