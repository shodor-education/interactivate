<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Remind students of what they have learned in the past that is relevant to the situation at hand.
  Ask the following questions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      What does it mean to estimate the answer to a problem?
    </li>
    <li>
      How does this differ from finding an
      <em>exact</em> answer?
    </li>
    <li>
      Raise your hand if your birthday is between January 1 and June 31.
      <ul>
        <li>
          How many people in this school do you think have birthdays in the first half of the year?
        </li>
        <li>
          If you were estimating that, what are some different ways you could phrase your answer?
          Could you use a number? A fraction? A percent?
        </li>
      </ul>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today we are going to investigate the relative merits of using fractions, percents, and
      decimals to estimate trees burned in a fire. Then, we will discuss how different algorithms
      can be used to make estimating easier, faster, and more accurate in certain situations.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will be using a computer to simulate burning down a forest and check our estimations, but
      please do not turn your computers on until I tell you to do so.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  Discuss the concept and utility of estimation. Ask the following questions:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What are some situations in which estimation would be more useful than actually counting out
      an exact number?
    </li>
    <li>
      There are three main ways to express estimated results - numbers, fractions, and percents
      <ul>
        <li>
          Can anyone describe how to estimate the number of objects with a certain property if the
          objects are difficult to count?
        </li>
        <li>
          What about the fraction of some objects with a certain property?
        </li>
        <li>
          What about the percent of some objects with a certain property?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can we convert between these three measures? How?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  Show the students the
  <a href="{{ '/activities/FireAssessment' | relative_url }}">Fire Assessment</a> applet. Set one of the trees on fire and watch the fire spread. Pose the following questions to
  the students:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      About how many trees do you think burned?
    </li>
    <li>
      About what proportion of the trees do you think burned, as a fraction?
    </li>
    <li>
      About what proportion of the trees do you think burned, as a percent?
    </li>
    <li>
      Which type of estimation was easiest - number, fraction, or percent?
    </li>
    <li>
      How close do you think your estimation was?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Put the class's estimate into the "Guess the Burn" box after first specifying whether you are
  entering numbers, percents, or fractions. Submit to check how close the class actually was.
</p>
<p>
  Demonstrate the different controls of the applet to students, including the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      How to change the percentage chance that a fire will spread
    </li>
    <li>
      How to change the forest size
    </li>
    <li>
      How to change between estimating percents, fractions, and numbers
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Data-Collection</h3>
<p>
  Have students work in groups of 2-4 to fill out the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Fire_Assessment_Worksheet' | relative_url }}">worksheet</a>. Assign each group a certain burn probability and forest size, then have them fill out the
  worksheet, estimating fractions, percents, and numbers of trees burned. As they work, instruct
  students to think about which type of estimation was easier/more accurate and why.
</p>
<p>
  When groups finish with the worksheet, have them write responses to the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Fire_Assessment_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> to reflect on their work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>
  Bring the class back together and discuss their responses to each of the exploration questions.
  Have students write their average error in estimation for percents, fractions, and numbers on the
  board. Based on those results, come to a conclusion as a class as to which type of estimation is
  the most accurate.
</p>
<p>
  Discuss with students the different methods of estimation and reasons why each may or may not have
  worked well in this exercise.
</p>
<p>
  Discuss other contexts for estimation and how the requirements can be different. Ask each group to
  come up with a situation in which their estimation algorithm would be most appropriate and discuss
  the various situations.
</p>
