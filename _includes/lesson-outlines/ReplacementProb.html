<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Remind students of what they learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about probability.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about probability, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Review the
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ProbabilityOfSimulta' | relative_url }}">Probability of Simultaneous Events</a> and
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/ConditionalProb' | relative_url }}">Conditional Probability</a> discussions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Begin by having the students experiment with a bag of marbles containing two different colored
      marbles to form a hypothesis about how replacement affects the probabilities on a second draw.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next have the students experiment with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Marbles' | relative_url }}">Marble Bag</a> activity, asking them to validate the activity by comparing their computer results and their
      actual results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead a discussion on
      <a href="{{ '/discussions/Replacement' | relative_url }}">Replacement</a> to confirm that students understand the difference between sampling with and without
      replacement.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Then have them turn on the "multiple trials" feature on the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/Marbles' | relative_url }}">Marble Bag</a> to develope a sense of the theoretical probabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next have the students formulate a hypothesis about the results with more than 2 colors of
      marbles. Ask them to come up with a general formula or process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare the results of the Marble Bag experiments to similar experiments with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/TwoColors' | relative_url }}">Two Colors game</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students write in their own words how replacement changes the probability of drawing
      objects.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
