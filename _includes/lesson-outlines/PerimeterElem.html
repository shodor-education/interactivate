<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Begin the lesson by asking the students if anyone has a fenced yard and ask them to think about
  how you might figure out how much fencing was required.
</p>
<p />
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let student know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Today we are going to be learning about the concept of perimeter and how to calculate perimeter.
  </li>
  <li>
    We are going to use the computers to learn about perimeter, but please do not turn your
    computers on or go to this page until I ask you to.
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the class measure the perimeter of their desk top using their hands as the unit of
      measure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss the different answers the students calculated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why the answers differed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Introduce the term perimeter.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work in pairs and measure the perimeter of 4 or 5 different objects around
      the room using different units: hands, feet, pencils, in, ft, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the students' progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a couple of students share their examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why it might be necessary to have a standard unit like: inches, feet, or meters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why someone might need to know the perimeter of something. (Example: fencing a yard)
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how to use the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}">Perimeter Explorer</a>. (You may want to specify certain area settings.) Have the students answer a couple of
      computer generated problems with you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how to draw the figure generated by the computer on a piece of graph paper.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work either alone or in groups of two with the
      <a href="{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}">Perimeter Explorer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      So you can check their progress, have the students copy the computer generated figures on a
      piece of graph paper.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Draw a grid on the board and draw a few shapes in the grid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call on several different students to help you determine the perimeter of each shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the meaning of the word perimeter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the different units used to measure perimeter.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
