<h3>Focus and Review</h3>
<p>
  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask the students if they remember how to divide in situations such as 15/4.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have students explain to one another how to divide with remainders.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we will be talking about modular arithmetic and how to use it to solve real
      world problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about modular arithmetic, but please do not turn
      your computers on or go to this page until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about
      this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Teacher Input</h3>
<p>
  Give the student this word problem: If I have 14 cookies, and I want to divide them evenly among 5
  students, how many cookies would each person get?
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask the students how to solve this problem, not what the answer is.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write the names of 5 students on the board like a clock-face. Draw a cookie next to each name
      as you "deal" out the cookies. Ask the students what the remainder is.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Explain to the students that 14 mod 5 is 4. Ask them what they think "mod" means. Then ask the
  students what 25 mod 3 is.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Focus on the process of how they solved the question, not the answer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure everyone understands the process, perhaps letting students pair-share with each
      other to solidify their understanding.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Guided Practice</h3>
<p>
  Open a browser to the
  <a href="{{ '/activities/ClockArithmetic' | relative_url }}">Clock Arithmetic applet</a>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Demonstrate to the class how the applet works. Remember to explain that the clock can be used
      to show more than just elapsed time.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a class, brainstorm ways that you could use this applet to solve the problems from before.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have students use the applet to demonstrate these solutions to the rest of the class.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Independent Practice</h3>
<p>
  Have the students work on the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Modular_Arithmetic_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">Modular Arithmetic Exploration Questions</a>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students discuss in groups how they solved the problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss as a class how to solve some of the more difficult problems.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Have the students complete the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Working_with_Remainders_Worksheet' | relative_url }}">Working with Remainders Worksheet</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Closure</h3>
<p>
  Discuss as a class how using the Clock Arithmetic applet makes solving these problems easier.
</p>
</li>
