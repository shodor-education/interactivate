  This lesson can be rearranged if there is only one available computer.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instead of having students complete Record Sheet in pairs, display the
      <strong>Compute</strong> mode on a classroom computer, record the dimensions on the whiteboard, and have students work
      independently to solve for the volume. When students have computed the volume, have one
      student enter the number to check answer.
    </li>
  </ul>
