<p>
  If students are already familiar with the equations for conic sections, this lesson can be
  rearranged in the following way:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Start by solving the equation of each conic section for
      <em>y</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how these solved equations relate to the distance formula.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss how the geometric interpretation of each conic section is equivalent to the algebraic
      interpretation.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
