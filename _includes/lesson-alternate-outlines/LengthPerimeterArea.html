  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways if there is only one available computer:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Don't play the game for speed. Have all students pull out a sheet of paper. Have the computer
      generate a set number of shapes and have them record on their paper the area and the perimeter
      (you record it as well). When you are done, take up the papers and check them the person with
      the most correct answers gets a reward of some type and the rest of the class gets a
      participation grade. That way everyone tries. Switch to the Triangle Explorer applet and do
      the same.
    </li>
  </ul>
