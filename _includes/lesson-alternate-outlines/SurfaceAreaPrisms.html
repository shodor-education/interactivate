<p>
  This lesson can be rearranged if there is only one available computer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Instead of having students use the applet in pairs, display the Compute mode on a classroom
    computer, record the dimensions on the whiteboard, and have students work independently to solve
    for the volume, surface area, and slant height. When students have computed the volume, surface
    area, and slant height, have one student enter the numbers to check the answers.
  </li>
</ul>
