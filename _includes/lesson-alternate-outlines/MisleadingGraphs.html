  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways if only one computer is available:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students create their graphs on paper after showing them the applets on the computer
    </li>
    <li>
      Have groups take turns creating their graphs on the computer so that everyone can use the
      applets
    </li>
  </ul>
