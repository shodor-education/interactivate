  For younger students, you may want to hand them a bag of shapes and have them create a bar graph
  similar to those found in the
  <a href="{{ '/activities/BarGraphSorter' | relative_url }}">Bar Graph Shape Sorter</a> applet, rather than having them survey the class and creating a bar graph using the
  <a href="{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}">Bar Graph</a> applet.
