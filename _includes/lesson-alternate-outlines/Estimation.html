  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the students pick up the concept of estimation right away, you may want to work together
      with them on the first worksheet, but then give them the other two to do independently.
    </li>
    <li>
      If students need more time to absorb the material, you might decide to give them only one or
      two of the estimation activities, or take two or more days to cover all the activities.
    </li>
  </ul>
