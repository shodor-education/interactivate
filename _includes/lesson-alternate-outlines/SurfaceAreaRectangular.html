  This lesson can be rearranged for if there is only one computer available in the classroom.

<ul>
  <li>
    Instead of having students complete Record Sheet in pairs, display the Compute mode on a
    classroom computer, record the dimensions on the whiteboard, and have students work
    independently to solve for the surface area. Once students have computed the surface area, have
    one student enter the number to check answer.
  </li>
</ul>
