<p>
  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways if there is only one available computer:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students visualize modular arithmetic using the Clock Arithmetic applet but work
      through problems without a computer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow students who need extra help to use the Clock Arithmetic applet to help them solve the
      problems.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
