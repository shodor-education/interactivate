      <em>Mixtures</em> allows the user to explore percent problems with two sets of circles. Each set of circles can
      have both colored and / or uncolored circles. The number of colored circles represents the
      percent of each pile. The user can select from four modes: exploration, unknown pile, unknown
      percent, or unknown total.
