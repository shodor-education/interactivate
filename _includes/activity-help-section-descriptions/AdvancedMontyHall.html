      This activity allows the user to simulate the Monty Hall Game by selecting any number of doors
      between 3 and 10. The player can choose a door to open; this will reveal what is behind
      several of the doors, leaving some doors still closed. The player must then decide to stick
      with the original choice or change doors to reveal the prize.
