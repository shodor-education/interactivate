      This activity allows the user to explore perimeter and area with either rectangular or
      irregular shapes on a grid. In Auto Draw Mode, the program will randomly generate shapes and
      ask the user for the perimeter and area of that shape. In Create Shape Mode, the user can
      build a shape and the program can either display the area and perimeter as the shape is built,
      or ask the user to enter the answers.
