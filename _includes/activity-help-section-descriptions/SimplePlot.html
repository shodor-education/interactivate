<p>
      This applet allows the user to input a series of (x, y) ordered pairs and plot them either as
      a connected function or unconnected data points. Parameters such as minimum and maximum x
      value, minimum and maximum y value, and x- and y-scale can be set by the user or determined by
      the applet.
