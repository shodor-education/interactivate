      This activity allows the user to graph recursive equations. The user specifies both the
      initial value and the recursive function for up to three equations. This activity uses the
      first 10 iterations of the equations to draw as points on the graph. The user may then flip
      through each equation on the graph and view the value at each graphed point.
