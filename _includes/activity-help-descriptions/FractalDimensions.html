      This activity allows the user to calculate the fractal dimension of a series of regular
      fractals without access to a calculator. It is not necessary to understand logarithms to use
      this activity. This activity shows the user generators for eleven line deformation fractals
      and two geometric fractals for which the scale factor and the number of copies must be input
      correctly.
