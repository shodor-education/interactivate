<p>
      This applet allows the user to input a series of (x,y) ordered pairs and plot them
      <em>in the order the pairs are input</em> either connected or as unconnected data points. Parameters such as minimum and maximum x
      value, minimum and maximum y value, and x- and y-scale can be set by the user or determined by
      the applet.
