      This activity allows the user to sort shapes into a bar graph by shape or color. There are two
      modes. The
      <strong>Random Set</strong> mode gives you a set of 6-15 random shapes to sort into a bar graph, or the
      <strong>Make Your Own</strong> mode which allows you to build your own bar graph by sorting shapes into the graph.
