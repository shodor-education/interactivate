    This applet allows the students to learn to multiply, add, simplify, and convert fractions,
    decimals, and percents by playing a game. This activity would work well in same-ability groups
    of two for about twenty minutes, if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/258.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a>, and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
