    This activity allows the user to see the results of a fire if a forest is densely planted in a
    rectangular grid when directional probabilities are set. This activity would work well in mixed
    ability groups of two for about thirty to forty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/479.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
