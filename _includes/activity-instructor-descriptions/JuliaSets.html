    This activity allows the user to investigate the Julia sets associated with functions
    <strong>f(Z) = Z^2 + C</strong> for any complex number C=(a,b) in the circle of radius 2. This activity would work well in
    groups of two to four for about twenty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/62.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
