    This activity allows the user to experiment with continuous or many-trial distributions where
    the mean, median, and mode are not the same. This activity would work well in mixed ability
    groups of two to four for about twenty to twenty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/69.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five to ten minutes otherwise.
