    This activity allows the user to run up to three different games of chance at once, allowing for
    comparison of experimental and theoretical probabilities. This activity would work well in
    groups of two for about twenty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/474.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
