      This activity allows the user to step through the process of building a Hilbert curve. This
      activity would work well in groups of two to four for about twenty minutes if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/466.pdf' | relative_url }}"> exploration questions</a> and five minutes otherwise.
