    This activity allows users to practice estimation skills by attempting to determine the number
    of individual objects shown, estimating the length of a curve based upon a given scale or
    estimating the area of a shape also based upon a given scale. This activity would work well in
    groups of 2 for about 15-20 minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/22.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 10-15 minutes otherwise.
