      This activity allows the user to practice their point plotting skills by having them move a
      robot through a mine field to a target location. Moves are accomplished by specifying the
      coordinates of the new location. In order to win, the path must not cross a mine. This
      activity would work well in groups of two for about fifteen minutes.
