    This activity allows the user to see functions typed in as algebraic expressions graphed on the
    coordinate plane. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about forty-five
    minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/107.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and twenty minutes otherwise.
