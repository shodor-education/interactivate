  This activity allows the user to explore Venn Diagrams with three circles. Students can sort
  shapes into known categories or can guess what the categories are by experimenting with sorting.
  This activity would work well in groups of two for twenty to thirty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Triple_Venn_Diagram_Shape_Sorter_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen otherwise.
