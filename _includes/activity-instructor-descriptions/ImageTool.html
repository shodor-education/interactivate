      This activity allows the user to measure angles, distances, and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/a' | relative_url }}">areas</a> in images. A scale feature allows the user to set the scale Image Tool uses for measuring
      distances and areas. This activity would work well in small groups of 2-3 for about 20-25
      minutes if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/59.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 10-15 minutes otherwise.
