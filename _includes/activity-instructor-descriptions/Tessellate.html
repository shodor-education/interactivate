    This activity allows the user to deform a triangle, rectangle or hexagon to form a polygon that
    tiles the plane. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about twenty-five
    minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/115.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and fifteen minutes otherwise.
