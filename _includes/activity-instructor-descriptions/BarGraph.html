    This activity allows the user to graph data on a bar graph . Students can use predefined data
    sets or enter their own data. Users can also change graph properties such as the scale and the
    color of the bars. This activity would work well in small groups of 3-4 for about 25-30 minutes
    if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/160.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15-20 minutes otherwise.
