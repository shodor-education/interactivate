  This activity allows the user to experiment with using random samples of various sizes to
  approximate standard deviations. Students can use this applet to understand how the variability of
  a sample changes based on both the number of trials and the standard deviation of the
  distribution. This activity would work best for groups of two to four students for about fifteen
  to twenty minutes.
