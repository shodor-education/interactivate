    This activity allows the user to practice their point plotting skills by having them move a
    robot through a mine field to a target location. Moves are accomplished by specifying the
    coordinates of the new location. In order to win, the path must not cross a mine. This activity
    would work well in groups of two for about thirty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/18.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and fifteen minutes otherwise.
