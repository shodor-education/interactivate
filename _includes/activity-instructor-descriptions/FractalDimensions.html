    This activity allows the user to calculate the fractal dimension of a series of regular fractals
    without access to a calculator. It is not necessary to understand logarithms to use this
    activity. This activity would work well in same ability groups of two to four for about
    thirty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/33.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
