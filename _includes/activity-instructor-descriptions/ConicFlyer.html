    This activity allows the user to experiment with changing constants and coefficients in a conic
    section. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about twenty-five to thirty
    minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/16.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five minutes per function type otherwise.
