    This activity displays a stem and leaf plot representing data either entered by the user or
    generated by the computer. The user can use the applet as a tool that creates a stem and leaf
    plot from data the user inputs, or to practice calculating the mean, median, and mode of a given
    data set. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about thirty minutes if you
    use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/112.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
