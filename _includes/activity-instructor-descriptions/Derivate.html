    This activity allows the user to explore the meaning of a derivative and why the value of the
    derivative is that value. This activity would work well in small groups of one or two people for
    about 20-25 minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/275.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15-20 minutes otherwise.
