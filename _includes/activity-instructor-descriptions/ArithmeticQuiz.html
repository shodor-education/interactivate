    This activity allows a student to practice his or her arithmetic with whole numbers and
    integers. The student can choose to answer problems involving whole number and
    <a href="{{ '/dictionary/i' | relative_url }}">integer</a> addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They can also choose the difficulty level
    and the amount of time they have to solve the problem. This activity would work well in groups
    of 2 for about 25-30 minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/454.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15-20 minutes otherwise.
