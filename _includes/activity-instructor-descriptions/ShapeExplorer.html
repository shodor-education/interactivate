      This applet allows users to practice calculating perimeter and area for irregular shapes. This
      activity would work well in mixed ability groups of two or three for about forty-five minutes
      if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/84.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and fifteen to twenty minutes otherwise.
