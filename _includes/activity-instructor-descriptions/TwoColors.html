  This activity allows the user to simulate pulling red and green balls out of boxes, in order to
  understand the concept of conditional probability. This activity would work well in groups of two
  to three for about twenty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/120.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
