  <p>
    This activity allows the user to graph data on a circle graph (
    <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">pie graph</a>). Students can use predefined data sets or enter their own data. This activity would work well
    in small groups of 3-4 for about 25-30 minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/93.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15-20 minutes otherwise.
