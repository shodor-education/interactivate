  This activity allows the user to plot ordered pairs and algebraic or trigonometric functions on
  the polar coordinate plane. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about
  forty-five minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Polar_Coordinates_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and twenty minutes otherwise.
