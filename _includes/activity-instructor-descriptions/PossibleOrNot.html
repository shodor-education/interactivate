  This activity allows the user to look at graphs of functions for real life situations, and asks
  them to decide if the graph is possible (makes sense) in context. This activity would work well in
  same ability groups of two to four for about fifteen to twenty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/60.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five to ten minutes otherwise.
