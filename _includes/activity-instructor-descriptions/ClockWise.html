    This activity allows the user to input any time through the day and see it displayed on the
    clock. The student can also choose to have a random time displayed and try to correctly identify
    it. This activity would work well in small groups of two to three for about ten to fifteen
    minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/231.pdf' | relative_url }}">record sheet</a> and five to ten minutes otherwise.
