    This activity allows the user to attempt to build curves that pass the vertical line test, so
    that they are functions. This activity would work well in mixed ability groups of two for about
    twenty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/396.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
