    This activity allows the user to plot points on the coordinate plane and to read the coordinates
    of a point plotted by the computer. This activity would work well in groups of two or three for
    about fifteen to twenty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/19.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
