    This activity allows the user to explore the world of tessellations on quadrilateral figures by
    dynamically changing the shape of the quadrilateral through dragging corners. This activity
    would work well in mixed ability groups of two or three for about twenty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/100.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
