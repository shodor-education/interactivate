      This activity allows the user to experiment with clock (modular) arithmetic. This activity
      would work well in mixed ability groups of two or three for about thirty minutes if you use
      the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/451.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and fifteen minutes otherwise.
