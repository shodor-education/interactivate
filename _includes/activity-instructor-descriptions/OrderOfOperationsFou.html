  This activity allows two users to play a game of order of operations where each player tries to
  connect four game pieces in a row before his or her opponent does. The players can choose to
  answer problems which use addition / subtraction, multiplication / division, exponents, and
  parentheses. They can also choose the difficulty level. This activity would work well in groups of
  2 for about 15-20 minutes.
