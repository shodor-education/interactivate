    This activity allows the user to experiment with continuous or many-trial distributions where
    the mean, median, and mode are the same. This activity would work well in mixed ability groups
    of two to four for about twenty-five minutes to thirty if you use the exploration questions and
    five to ten minutes otherwise.
