  This activity allows the user to simulate the Monty Hall Game with up to 10 doors in which the
  user chooses a door, and then all but one door is opened to reveal a stinking pig. The player must
  then decide to stick with the original choice or change. This activity would work well in groups
  of two to three for about thirty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/75.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
