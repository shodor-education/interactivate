    This activity allows the user to run a simulation of dropping a needle on a lined sheet of paper
    and determining the probability of the needle crossing one of the lines. This activity would
    work well in groups of two for about ten to fifteen minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Buffon_s_Needle_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five to ten minutes otherwise.
