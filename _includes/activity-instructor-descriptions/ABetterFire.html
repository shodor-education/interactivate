  This activity allows the user to see the results of a fire spreading through a forest. The user
  can oberserve how properties like wind speed, wind direction, and forest density affect how the
  fire spreads. This activity would work well in mixed ability groups of two to four for about
  fifteen to twenty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/450.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
