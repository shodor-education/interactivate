    This activity allows the user to step through the tortoise and hare race, which is based upon
    Zeno's Paradox about Achilles and the tortoise. This activity would work well in groups of one
    or two for about ten to fifteen minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/116.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five minutes otherwise.
