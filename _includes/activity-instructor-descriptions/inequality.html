  This activity allows the user to plot ordered pairs and linear inequality relations on the same
  coordinate plane. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about forty-five
  minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Linear_Inequalities_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and twenty minutes otherwise.
