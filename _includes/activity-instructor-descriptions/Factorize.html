      This activity allows the user to find all of the factorizations of a given number and then
      visually plot them on a grid. Users can choose to enter in their own numbers and can also
      receive hints if they are having trouble. This activity would work well in groups of 2 for
      about 25 minutes if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/25.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15 minutes otherwise.
