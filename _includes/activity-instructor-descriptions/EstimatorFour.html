      This activity allows two users to play a game of
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">estimation</a> where each player tries to connect four game pieces in a row before his or her opponent does.
      The players earn game pieces by accurately estimating the answers to various problems. Users
      can choose to estimate addition, multiplication, and
      <a href="{{ '/dictionary/p' | relative_url }}">percentage</a> problems. This activity would work well in groups of 2 for about 25-30 minutes if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/21.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 15-20 minutes otherwise.
