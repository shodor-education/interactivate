    This activity allows the user to view box plots for either built-in or user-specified data, and
    experiment with outliers. This activity would work well in groups of two to four for about
    twenty to twenty-five minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/169.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
