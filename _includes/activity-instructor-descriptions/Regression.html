  The regression applet is designed to allow the user to plot a bivariate data set, determine the
  line of best fit for their data, and then check the accuracy of their line of best fit. This
  activity determines the correlation coefficient, r, for the true lines of best fit and also
  exposes students to residuals. This activity would work well in groups of two or three for about
  10-15 minutes.
