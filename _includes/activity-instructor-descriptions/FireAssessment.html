  This activity allows users to practice estimation skills by attempting to determine the percent of
  trees burned, the number of trees burned, and the fraction of trees burned in a forest. This
  activity would work well in groups of two for about 1 hour if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/Fire_Assessment_Exploration_Questions' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 10-15 minutes otherwise.
