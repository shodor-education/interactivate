  This activity allows the user to play a game in which two players move towards the finish line
  based on the roll of a six-sided die. This activity would work well in mixed ability groups of two
  or three for about twenty minutes if you use the
  <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/102.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
