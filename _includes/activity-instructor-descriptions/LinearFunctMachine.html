<p>
  This activity allows the user to explore simple linear functions; the function is determined by
  looking for patterns in the outputs. The function is always a simple line of the following form:
  \{y = m * x + b\} where m, the
  <em>slope</em>, and b, the
  <em>y-intercept</em>, can be any integer between -10 and 10. This activity would work well in same ability groups of
  two to three for about forty-five minutes if you use the and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
