    This activity allows the user to explore experimental and theoretical probabilities by adding
    and removing sections of a circle. This activity would work well in groups of two for about
    fifteen to twenty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/110.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten minutes otherwise.
