    This activity allows the user to simulate how nature keeps its balance. This applet shows how
    wolves and rabbits would behave in their natural setting. This activity would work well in
    groups of two to four for about thirty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/101.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and ten to fifteen minutes otherwise.
