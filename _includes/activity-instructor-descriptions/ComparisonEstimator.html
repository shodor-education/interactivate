    This activity allows the user to compare two quantities (which may be the number of objects in
    each of two sets, the lengths of two curves, or the area of two shapes) by
    <a href="{{ '/dictionary/e' | relative_url }}">estimating</a>. This activity would work well in small groups of 2-4 for about 20-25 minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/23.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and 10-15 minutes otherwise.
