      This activity allows the user to explore area and perimeter by either allowing the computer to
      randomly draw a shape on a grid or allowing the user to build the shape on the grid. This
      activity would work well in mixed ability groups of two or three for about twenty-five minutes
      if you use the
      <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/448.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and fifteen to twenty minutes otherwise.
