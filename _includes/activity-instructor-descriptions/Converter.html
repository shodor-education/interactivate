    This applet allows the user to explore converting decimals to fractions and fractions to
    decimals. This activity would work well in mixed ability groups of three or four for about
    thirty minutes if you use the
    <a href="{{ '/media/worksheets/251.pdf' | relative_url }}">exploration questions</a> and five to ten minutes otherwise.
