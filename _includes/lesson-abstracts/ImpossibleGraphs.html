  This lesson is devoted to impossible graphs. Users of the module can learn to distinguish between
  possible and impossible graphs of functions, and to learn why some graphs are impossible. These
  activities together give a brief lesson that can be completed in as little as 30 minutes
  class-time, depending on how many teams need to share their ideas. The discovery process takes
  about 15 minutes, and each presentation about 5 minutes.
