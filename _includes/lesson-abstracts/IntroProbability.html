  An activity and two discussions of this lesson introduce the concept of probability and the basic
  set operations that are useful in solving probability problems that involve counting outcomes.
  This material is the basis of the so-called
  <strong>naive probability theory</strong>. In contrast with axiomatic probability theory that deals with abstract,
  <strong>axiom-driven concepts</strong>, the naive theory is built upon intuitive and experimental knowledge.
