  The activity and two discussions of this lesson connect probability and geometry. The Polyhedra
  discussion leads to platonic solids, and the Probability and Geometry discussion leads to
  connections between angles, areas and probability. The subtle difference between defining
  probability by counting outcomes and defining probability by measuring proportions of geometrical
  characteristics is brought to light.
