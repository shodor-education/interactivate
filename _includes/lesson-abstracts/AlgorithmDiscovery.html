<p>
  This lesson is designed to help students learn about algorithms through
  <a href="{{ '/dictionary/v' | relative_url }}">Venn Diagrams</a> and
  <a href="{{ '/dictionary/b' | relative_url }}">Box Plots</a>. Students will develop algorithms for solving Venn Diagrams, collect data for each algorithm, and
  compare the efficiency of each algorithm, using box plots.
