<p>
  The goal of this lesson is to introduce histograms, bar graphs and the concept of class interval.
  An activity and three discussions with supplemental exercises help students learn how data can be
  graphically represented (and mis-represented). Students will learn to distinguish between bar
  graphs and histograms and to use each in the appropriate situations.
