category: "AP Calculus"
description: "APC.11 The student will find antiderivatives directly from derivatives of basic functions and by substitution of variables (including change of limits for definite integrals). * * AP Calculus BC will also include finding antiderivatives by parts and simple partial fractions (nonrepeating linear factors only), and finding improper integrals as limits of definite integrals. * AP Calculus BC will also solve logistic differential equations and use them in modeling."
grade-band: "7"
