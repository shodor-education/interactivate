description: "APC.15 The student will use integration techniques and appropriate integrals to model physical, biological, and economic situations. The emphasis will be on using the integral of a rate of change to give accumulated change or on using the method of setting up an approximating Riemann sum and representing its limit as a definite integral. Specific applications will include the area of a region; the volume of a solid with known cross-section; the average value of a function; and, the distance traveled by a particle along a line. * * AP Calculus BC will include finding the area of a region (including a region bounded by polar curves) and finding the length of a curve (including a curve given in parametric form)."
