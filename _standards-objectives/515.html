description: "APC.07 The student will analyze the derivative of a function as a function in itself. This will include comparing corresponding characteristics of the graphs of f, f ', and f \"; defining the relationship between the increasing and decreasing behavior of f and the sign of f '; translating verbal descriptions into equations involving derivatives and vice versa; analyzing the geometric consequences of the Mean Value Theorem; defining the relationship between the concavity of f and the sign of f \"; and, identifying points of inflection as places where concavity changes and finding points of inflection."
