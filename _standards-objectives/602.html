description: "AII/T.26 The student, given one of the six trigonometric functions in standard form [e.g., y = A sin (Bx + C) + D, where A, B, C, and D are real numbers], will state the domain and the range of the function; determine the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift; and, sketch the graph of the function by using transformations for at least a one-period interval. The graphing calculator will be used to investigate the effect of changing A, B, C, and D on the graph of a trigonometric function."
