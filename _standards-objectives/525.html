This will include Taylor polynomial approximations with graphical demonstration of convergence; Maclaurin series and the general Taylor series centered at x = a; Maclaurin series for the functions ex, sin x, cos x, and 1/(1 - x); formal manipulation of Taylor series and shortcuts to computing Taylor series, including substitution, differentiation, antidifferentiation, and the formation of new series from known series; functions defined by power series; radius and interval of convergence of power series; and, Lagrange error bound of a Taylor polynomial. * * For those students who are enrolled in AP Calculus BC."
