description: "Color numbers in Pascal's Triangle by rolling a number and then clicking on all entries that have the same remainder when divided by the number rolled, thereby practicing division and remainders, investigating number patterns, and investigating fractal patterns.  Coloring Remainders in Pascal's Triangle is one of the Interactivate assessment explorers."
