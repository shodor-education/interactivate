      Quiz</a> and
      <a href="{{ 'activities/FractionFour' | relative_url }}">Fraction
      Four</a>, questions are designed to help the user practice simplifying, 
      converting, and multiplying
      decimals, percentages, and fractions and to prepare them for questions of 
      various levels of
      difficulty. Questions are categorized by a combination of level (which 
      determines the
      difficulty) and by types of problems listed. These different categories 
      are defined in two
      different organizational structures. The first organization looks at 
      problem types, then
      considers how problems vary by level within that type. The second 
      organization considers the
      difficulty level first, then looks at different problem types within that 
      level. All number
      ranges are inclusive. Both are provided below.

          than 300. Fractions will not be in reduced form, but can be reduced 
          to fractions with
          denominators between 2 and 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraction &lt;-&gt; Decimal:</strong> Convert between 
          fractions and decimals. Fractions may not be in reduced form, but can be
          reduced to fractions with denominators between 2 and 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fraction &lt;-&gt; Percentage:</strong> Convert between 
          fractions and percentages. Fractions may not be in reduced form, but are
          based on fractions with denominators between 2 and 12.

          <strong>Algebra:</strong> Find x by combining like terms or 
          eliminating the coefficient of x. Fractional terms may
          have different denominators and answers may be negative.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparing Fractions:</strong> Determine the fraction with a 
          greater value. Fractions may not be in reduced form, but
          can be reduced to fractions with denominators between 2 and 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reducing Fractions:</strong> Reduce a fraction and express it 
          in lowest terms. The fraction will reduce to a fraction
          with a denominator of between 2 and 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adding and Subtracting Fractions:</strong> Add or subtract 
          two fractions with denominators between 2 and 100 and express answer in
          lowest terms. Answer may be a proper fraction, an improper fraction, 
          and/or negative.

          <strong>Multiplying and Dividing Fractions:</strong> One of three 
          problem types:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Multiply two fractions and report in lowest terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divide two fractions and report in lowest terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find a fractional portion of a whole number less than 200. The 
              denominator of the
              fraction will be less than 20, but may not be a factor of the 
              whole number, resulting
              in decimal answers to be rounded to the thousandths place.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rounding Decimals:</strong> Round a decimal with four decimal 
          places to the nearest hundredth place or a decimal with
          five decimal places to the nearest thousandth place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improper Fractions &lt;-&gt; Mixed Numbers:</strong> Convert 
          between improper fractions and their mixed number equivalents and report answer
          in lowest terms. The denominators of all fractions will be between 2 
          and 20, and the whole
          number portion will be less than 5.
