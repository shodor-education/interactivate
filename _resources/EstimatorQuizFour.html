      Quiz</a> and
      <a href="{{ 'activities/EstimatorFour' | relative_url }}">Estimator
      Four</a>, questions are designed to help the user practice estimating the
      results of addition,
      multiplication, and percentage, and to prepare them for questions of
      various levels of
      difficulty. Questions are categorized by a combination of level (which
      determines the
      difficulty) and by types of problems listed. These different categories
      are defined in two
      different organizational structures. The first organization looks at
      problem types, then
      considers how problems vary by level within that type. The second
      organization considers the
      difficulty level first, then looks at different problem types within that
      level. All number
      ranges are inclusive. Both are provided below.
