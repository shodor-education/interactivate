      In
      <a href="{{ 'activities/OperationsQuiz' | relative_url }}">Order of
      Operations Quiz</a> and
      <a href="{{ 'activities/OrderOfOperationsFou' | relative_url }}">Order of
      Operations Four</a>, questions are designed to help the user to practice 
      order of operations with
      addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, exponents, and 
      parentheses, and to prepare them
      for questions of various levels of difficulty. Questions are categorized 
      by a combination of
      level (which determines the difficulty) and by types of problems listed. 
      These different
      categories are defined in two different organizational structures. The 
      first organization
      looks at problem types, then considers how problems vary by level within 
      that type. The second
      organization considers the difficulty level first, then looks at 
      different problem types
      within that level. All number ranges are inclusive. Both are provided 
      below.
