      <a href="{{ 'activities/AlgebraQuiz' | relative_url }}">Algebra Quiz</a> and
      <a href="{{ 'activities/AlgebraFour' | relative_url }}">Algebra Four</a>,
      questions are designed to help the user practice solving linear and
      quadratic algebraic equations, and to prepare them for questions of various
      levels of difficulty. Questions are categorized by a combination of level
      (which determines the difficulty) and by types of problems listed. These
      different categories are defined in two different organizational structures.
      The first organization looks at problem types, then considers how problems
      vary by level within that type. The second organization considers the
      difficulty level first, then looks at different problem types within that
      level. All number ranges are inclusive. Both are provided below.

    <h2>Descriptions by Problem Type:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Variables on Both Sides:</strong>

        <li>
          <strong>Whole Numbers Only:</strong> Solve for x by combining like
          terms from both
          sides of the equation. Answers and coefficients will be integers
          between 1 and 5, and constants will be integers between 1
          and 50, with most between 1 and 25.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Level 1:</strong> Solve for x by combining like terms from both
          sides of the equation. Answers and
          coefficients will be integers between -5 and 5, and constants will be
          between -50 and 50,
          with most between -25 and 25.

        <li>
          <strong>Level 2:</strong> Solve for x by combining like terms from both
          sides of the equation. Coefficients and
          constants in the equation will be integers, but answers may be
          fractions.
