      Quiz</a> and
      <a href="{{ 'activities/ArithmeticFour' | relative_url }}">Arithmetic
      Four</a>,
      questions are designed to help the user get practice in addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, and division, and to prepare them for
      questions of various levels of difficulty. Questions are categorized by a
      combination of level (which determines the difficulty) and by types of
      problems listed. These different categories are defined in two different
      organizational structures. The first organization looks at problem types,
      then considers how problems vary by level within that type. The second
      organization considers the difficulty level first, then looks at different
      problem types within that level. All number ranges are inclusive. Both are
      provided below.
