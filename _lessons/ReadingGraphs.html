abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is designed to introduce students to graphing functions and to reading simple
  functions from graphs. Many of the examples are motivated by a situation described by the graph.
</p>
<p />
<p>
  These activities can be done individually or in teams of as many as four students. Allow for 2-3
  hours of class time for the entire lesson if all portions are done in class.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Can anyone give me an example of a function? Can anyone give me an example of an everyday
      situation that a function can be applied to?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn more about functions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn more about functions, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

objectives:
  - "have practiced plotting functions on the Cartesian coordinate plane"
  - "have seen several categories of functions, including lines and parabolas"
  - "be able to read a graph, answering questions about the situation described by the graph"
student-prerequisites:
  - category: "Arithmetic"
    prereqs:
      - "perform integer and fractional arithmetic"
      - "plot points on the Cartesian coordinate system"
      - "read the coordinates of a point from a graph"
  - category: "Algebraic"
    prereqs:
      - "work with very simple algebraic expressions"
  - category: "Technological"
    prereqs:
      - "perform basic mouse manipulations such as point, click and drag"
      - "use a browser for experimenting with the activities"
subjects:
  - "Algebra"
  - "Modeling"
  - "Statistics"
suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, students will have more experience with functions and
  relationship between the English description, graphical and algebraic representations. The next
  lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/ImpossibleGraphs' | relative_url }}\">Impossible Graphs</a>, shows the students that not all graphs make sense in certain situations.
