abstract: "<p>
  This lesson explores sampling with and without replacement, and its effects on the probability of
  drawing a desired object. It is designed to follow the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/ConditionalProb' | relative_url }}\">Conditional Probability and Probability of Simultaneous Events</a> lesson to further clarify the role of replacement in calculating probabilities.

  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:

    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about probability.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about probability, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

      Begin by having the students experiment with a bag of marbles containing two different colored
      marbles to form a hypothesis about how replacement affects the probabilities on a second draw.

    <li>
      Next have the students experiment with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Marbles' | relative_url }}\">Marble Bag</a> activity, asking them to validate the activity by comparing their computer results and their
      actual results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead a discussion on
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/Replacement' | relative_url }}\">Replacement</a> to confirm that students understand the difference between sampling with and without

      Then have them turn on the \"multiple trials\" feature on the

    </li>
    <li>
      Next have the students formulate a hypothesis about the results with more than 2 colors of
      marbles. Ask them to come up with a general formula or process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare the results of the Marble Bag experiments to similar experiments with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/TwoColors' | relative_url }}\">Two Colors game</a>.

objectives:
  - "have taken a closer look at probability"
  - "have learned the difference between sampling with and without replacement"
student-prerequisites:
  - category: "Arithmetic"
    prereqs:
      - "use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to solve probability formulas"
      - "understand how tables can be used in multiplication"
  - category: "Technological"
    prereqs:
      - "perform basic mouse manipulations such as point, click and drag"

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the students will have worked with conditional
  probability, sampling with and without replacement, and have seen the formula for the probability
  of simultaneous events. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/ProbabilityToCombinatorics' | relative_url }}\">From Probability to Combinatorics and Number Theory</a>, devotes itself to data structures and their applications to probability theory. Tables and trees
  are introduced, and some of their properties are discussed.

          For the

            <li>
              10 to 20 marbles of varying colors
            </li>

          three identical containers (e.g., small boxes or opaque cups)
        </li>
        <li>
          six objects of two different colors (three of each color), such as marbles or poker chips.
          The objects have to fit in the containers and have to be indistinguishable from each other
          by touch.
        </li>
        <li>

    <li>
      All activities in the lesson are better experienced by using the software, with individual
      students or small groups of students having enough time to explore the games and find answers
      to the related questions. If the activities have to be set up physically, the above materials
      are necessary (one set of materials for each group of students that will be doing the
      activity).
