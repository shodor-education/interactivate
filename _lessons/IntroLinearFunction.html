abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is designed to introduce students to the idea of functions composed of two operations,
  with specific attention to linear functions and their representations as rules and data tables,
  including the mathematical notions of independent and dependent variables.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson assumes that the student is already familiar with the material in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/IntroductionFunction' | relative_url }}\">Introduction to Functions</a> Lesson. These activities can be done individually or in teams of as many as four students. Allow
  for 2-3 hours of class time for the entire lesson if all portions are done in class.

  <ul>

      Omit the information on more complicated functions, discussing only functions of the form y =
      mx + b.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a \"name that function\" contest (modeled on name that tune) in which teams of students
      compete to figure out the function. Here is a set of possible rules for such a game:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Show two input/output pairs to both teams - two students on a team works very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have each team state how many more pairs they think that they would need to see to \"name
          that function.\" The team who claims the fewest needed pairs goes first.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a team guesses wrong the other team gets to try, after seeing one more pair. Teams
          alternate turns until one guesses correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Introduce more complicated non-linear functions by allowing exponentiation (whole numbers to
      start) and division by x.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students practice \"pumping\" a few of these more complicated functions by hand by
      filling in a few tables. Give them some functions in English, some as tables and some as
      algebra. Have them write the functions in all the forms. For Example:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Find the function that adds one and then multiplies the result by 2
        </li>
        <li>
          y = 4 - x/2
