  If only one computer is available for the classroom, this lesson can be rearranged in the
  following way:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The teacher may do this activity as a demonstration. Have students volunteer different inputs
      for the Whole Number Cruncher. Then graph those input/output pairs as a class using GraphIt.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a class, analyze the different graphs that are created and discuss the results.
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  Give students a simple problem:
  <ul>
    <li>
      There's a \"number cruncher\" that takes a number and changes it somehow by following a rule.
    </li>
    <li>
      If I put a 1 into the number cruncher, it spits out a 2. What do you think the rule is?
    </li>
    <li>
      It might be doubling the number or it could be adding one. Those are good guesses, but we need
      more information.
    </li>
    <li>
      I put a 2 into the same number cruncher, and it spits out a 3. What do you think the rule is
      now?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Objective"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn more about rules like this and how they relate to graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn more about this, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  Introduce students to the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/WholeNumberCruncher' | relative_url }}\">Whole Number Cruncher</a>. Explain that this is just like the number cruncher from before. Demonstrate how it works by
  asking students what input you should use and observing the output. Ask students questions such as
  the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      How many numbers do you have to put in before you know what the formula is? Are you sure you
      don't need more? Could you figure it out with fewer inputs?
    </li>
    <li>
      What numbers can you use as input?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there numbers that make it easier to figure out the formula? Why or why not?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Have students work in groups to develop their own input/output list, using the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/WholeNumberCruncher' | relative_url }}\">Whole Number Cruncher</a>. Have all students use the same function by using
  <link base=\"PATH:resources\" href=\"/SeedRandom\">seed random</a>. Remind all students to stay on that function.
</p>
<p>
  Once students have developed lists of input/output pairs, use a projector to show the students
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Graphit' | relative_url }}\">GraphIt</a>. As a class, plot input/output pairs on the graph.
</p>
<p>
  Ask students to solve the formula in Whole Number Cruncher. When students have the computer
  confirm the right answer, type that formula into GraphIt. Ask students questions such as the
  following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does the graph confirm that you were correct? How do you know?
    </li>
    <li>
      What shape is the graph of the formula?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Ask students to make predictions about the graphs they're going to look at. Ask questions such as
  the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do you think the graph of the formula goes through every input/output pair? Are there any
      exceptions?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you think all functions have graphs that look like lines? Why or why not?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Have students work in groups to complete the
  <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Functional_Graphs_Worksheet' | relative_url }}\">Functional Graphs Worksheet</a>.
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  Lead a class discussion of the findings of the lesson. Ask questions such as the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Why do you think it's important that the graph is \"linear\"?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can that help us at all in making predictions? How?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Take a moment to address the misconception that all functions are lines. Explain that the
  functions we looked at are all called \"linear\" functions, which is why they all made lines. There
  are many different functions out there, and only some of them are linear.
