  <ul>
    <li>
      Remind students what they learned about converting between fractions and decimals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead into lesson by asking students if they know of another way of representing fractional
      amounts besides fractions and decimals.
    </li>

    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today we will be learning about percents and how to convert fractions, decimals, and
      percentages.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead a
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/Percents' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a> on percents.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students how they think you should convert from fractions or decimals into percentages.
    </li>
    <li>
      After discussing different possible methods, explain to students that you can convert to
      percentages by converting to a fraction over 100, and just using the numerator with the
      percent sign: %.
