abstract: "<p>
  This lesson introduces students to the idea that probability and geometry are sometimes linked.
  Students will practice what they already know about geometry to learn more about probability.

  If only one computer is available, this lesson can be rearranged in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students construct spinners with different sized sections out of several different
      materials, and then compare the results they obtain. Which materials or designs produce
      spinners that produce more truly \"random\" results? Compare the results of many spins with
      these spinners with the computer-generated results from the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BasicSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Spinner Game</a> and the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdjustableSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Adjustable Spinner Game</a> to show students the advantage of using a computer model to produce accurate results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give extra time with the applets for students who are having trouble understanding.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Who has ever watched the game wheel of fortune?
    </li>
    <li>
      Have you ever noticed when they put the $10,000 space on the wheel it is significantly smaller
      than the rest of the spaces?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you think size of the space affects whether or not you will land on the space?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to begin learning about probability and its relationship to
      geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about probability, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
