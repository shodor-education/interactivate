      Today, class, we are going to learn more about fractals, the idea of self-similarity, and
      recognizing patterns within fractals.

    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn more about fractals, the idea of self-similarity,
      and recognizing patterns with in fractals, but please do not turn your computers on until I
      ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Walk students through several steps of the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/SierpinskiTriangle' | relative_url }}\">Sierpinski Triangle</a>. The students should look at the patterns made by the areas of the individual triangles and
      the total area. It may take drawing two or three iterations before the number pattern becomes
      obvious.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss the number of triangles present in each iteration see if any of your students can
      recognize the pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students discuss what they believe will happen to the area of Sierpinki's Triangle as
      the number of iterations go beyond the computers computational capability. Will the area of
      the triangle ever reach zero?

    <li>
      Lead a class

      If you choose to hand out the worksheets that accompany these applets you can have the

      An alternative is to have the students calculate the area Sierpinski's carpet and triangle at
      several different iterations.

objectives:
  - "have seen the classic geometric fractals"
  - "have reinforced their sense of infinity, self-similarity and recursion"
  - "have practiced their fraction, pattern recognition, perimeter and area skills"

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen a few of the classic plane
  figure fractals to compare with those from the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/InfinityRecursion' | relative_url }}\">Infinity, Self-Similarity, and Recursion</a> lesson. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\"> Fractals and the Chaos Game</a>, continues the student's exploration of fractals by showing how other, seemingly different, ideas
  can generate the same kinds of fractals.
