abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is designed to familiarize students to the Cartesian Coordinate System and its many
  uses in the world of mathematics. The Cartesian coordinate system was developed by the
  mathematician Descartes during an illness. As he lay in bed sick, he saw a fly buzzing around on
  the ceiling, which was made of square tiles. As he watched he realized that he could describe the
  position of the fly by the ceiling tile he was on. After this experience he developed the
  coordinate plane to make it easier to describe the position of objects.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is best if the students work in small groups of two or three.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose a student in the class, ask another student to describe that person's location in the
      classroom. For example 3rd row 4th seat back. Use this as an application of the coordinate
      system

  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about cartesian coordinate system.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn cartesian coordinate system, but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

      For further practice or an alternative game, have the students play the

    <li>
      To show students that the coordinate plane is useful in more than just describing the location
      of objects lead a discussion on
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/FromGraphsToFunction' | relative_url }}\">reading points off a graph</a>. This will show the students that they can read graphs and find the equations of lines using
