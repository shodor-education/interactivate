  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways if there is only one available computer:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have all students pull out a sheet of paper. Have the computer generate a set number of shapes
      and have them record on their paper the area (you record it as well). When you are done, take
      up the papers and check them. The person with the most correct answers gets a reward of some
      type and the rest of the class gets a participation grade. That way everyone tries.
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask students to recall information about polygons.
    </li>
    <li>
      You might ask students to consider how they might find the area of their desk.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss what it might mean to talk about the area of a polygon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students if they know what perimeter is. If they do not understand perimeter, give a brief
      explanation of it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we will be talking more about the area of polygons. We will learn exactly what
      the term area means and how to calculate area for random shapes with a fixed perimeter. We
      will also learn what effect the shape of the perimeter has on the area of the object. Finally,
      we will learn how the size of the perimeter affects the number of different possible areas
      that can be contained by the given perimeter.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about area, but please do not turn your computers
      on or go to this page until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AreaExplorer' | relative_url }}\">Area Explorer</a> applet first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  You may choose to lead the students in a short
  <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/Area' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a> about how to find the area and perimeter of irregular figures.
</p>
<p>
  Explain to the students how to do the assignment. You should model or demonstrate it for the
  students, especially if they are not familiar with how to use the computer applets.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open your browser to
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AreaExplorer' | relative_url }}\">Area Explorer</a> in order to demonstrate this activity to the students.
    </li>
    <li>
      Area is the amount of space inside the figure. So imagine the grid lines mark off floor tiles
      like the ones we have here at school. Many floor tiles are one-foot squares. So to find the
      amount of space in the object we just need to count the floor tiles. That would give us the
      area of the floor in square feet. Similarly, we will do the same with finding the area of the
      objects on the grid, just count the number of squares. Note, though there is no specified unit
      of measure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once we have calculated the area we will put our answer in the text field and click the check
      answer button.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you choose to, you may pass out the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/88.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Worksheet to accompany the \"Area\" Applet</a> and the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/205.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Record Sheet</a> so that students can record the necessary information to complete the worksheet.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Try another example, letting the students direct your moves. Or, you may simply ask, \"Can anyone
  describe the steps you will take for this assignment?\"
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If your class seems to understand the process for doing this assignment, simply ask, \"Can
      anyone tell me what you will do now?\"
    </li>
    <li>
      If your class seems to be having a little trouble with this process, do example together, but
      let the students direct your actions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          \"Can someone describe how I would find the area of this shape?\"
        </li>
        <li>
          \"How does the shape of the perimeter affect the area of the shape?\"
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Allow the students to work on their own and to complete the worksheet, should you choose to
      provide one. Monitor the room for questions and be sure the students are on the correct web
      site
    </li>
    <li>
      Another option for independent practice is to have the students work in pairs (carefully
      chosen so that both students are of the same ability group). Have them race to find the
      correct area using the Area applet. Whoever wins gets a point. At the end of the allotted time
      for the game give the winning member of each pair a reward of some type.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the students
  have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
