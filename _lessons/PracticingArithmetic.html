abstract: "<p>
  This lesson allows students to practice their arithmetic skills and check their answers using the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Graphit' | relative_url }}\">Graphit</a> activity.
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  This lesson utilizes the mathematical fact that the graph of a linear function can be developed
  from the equation y = bx or y = x + b. Students are given a list of arithmetic problems where all
  of the problems are of the same operation and the same operand (represented in the equations as
  b), while the second operand varies (represented in the equations as x). The second operand and
  the result (represented in the equations as y), are then graphed as ordered pairs. If the student
  answers the problems correctly, all ordered pairs will fall in a straight line.

      Problem sets can be done prior to class or during class.

  - heading: "Focus and Review"
    content: "<p>
  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Review any algorithms they have learned to complete the specific type of arithmetic problems
      you would like them to practice
    </li>
    <li>
      Students should complete the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/192.pdf' | relative_url }}\">practice problems</a> prior to this lesson.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to use the computers to help practice our arithmetic skills.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Graphit' | relative_url }}\">Graphit!</a> activity, demonstrate how to use the activity to check their answers to their practice
      problems. Use the following set of problems or your own set:
      <ul>
        <li>
          3+2=5
        </li>
        <li>
          3+5=8
        </li>
        <li>
          3+7=10
        </li>
        <li>
          3+9=12.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The input from this problem set should be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          2,5
        </li>
        <li>
          5,8
        </li>
        <li>
          7,10
        </li>
        <li>
          9,12
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      After these ordered pairs are graphed show the students what an incorrect answer will look
      like. Use your own problem or 3 + 1 = 3 and the data point 1,3. Note that this data point will
      not fall on the line
    </li>
    <li>
      You can then enter in \"the rule\" 3 + x in the
      <em>y(x)</em>= text box. This line will be the line all graphed points should fall on. If a point does not
      fall on this line then the student has an incorrect answer and should go back and double check
      his/her work
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using the first set of
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/192.pdf' | relative_url }}\">practice problems</a> , call on the students in the class to tell you what should be the input. Call on a different
      student for each data point then graph the result
    </li>
    <li>
      Call on a student to tell you what you should enter as \"the rule.\"
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Students should complete other problem sets (this can be done either in class or prior to this
      lesson)
    </li>
    <li>
      Students should input their data sets and rules. If a point does not lie on the line, they
      should go back and determine which answer in their problem set was incorrect.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings.
