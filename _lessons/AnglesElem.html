  <ul>
    <li>
      One computer could be connected to a projector in order to display each of the ten problems
      that the students would complete individually.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ten different problems could be printed off to provide students with a paper reference to use
      while completing the worksheet.

  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about angles.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to learn about ways to classify angles:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Acute Angle
        </li>
        <li>
          Obtuse Angle
        </li>
        <li>
          Right Angle

  <ul>

      drop-down menu.

    <li>
      Ask students to point out which angles are acute, obtuse, and right.
    </li>
    <li>
      Show the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Angles_Elem_Worksheet' | relative_url }}\">Angles Worksheet</a> to students and explain that they are supposed to write the names of all the angles that are
      acute in the acute column, etc.
