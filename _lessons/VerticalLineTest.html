abstract: "<p>
  The following discussions and activities are designed to lead the students to explore the the
  vertical line test for functions. Plotting points and drawing simple piecewise functions are
  practiced along the way.
</p>
<p />
<p>
  This lesson can be done with individual students or in groups of any size. It is a brief lesson,
  with the short version taking as little and 30 minutes.

      Add a discussion about fractional movement on the coordinate plane.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have been practicing plotting points on the cartesian coordinate plane. (Draw a line on a
      graph on the board.) Does anyone have any ideas on how we could tell people how to draw this
      exact same line on another graph without showing it to them?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about graphing functions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about graphing functions, but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
