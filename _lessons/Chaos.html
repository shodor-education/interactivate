abstract: "<p>
  The following discussions and activities are designed to lead the students to explore various
  incarnations of chaos. This lesson is best implemented with students working in teams of 2,
  alternating being the \"driver\" and the \"recorder\" using the computer activities.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reduce the number of activities; for example, use only the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ABetterFire' | relative_url }}\">Better Fire!</a> and
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Life' | relative_url }}\">Game of Life</a> activities to give the classic examples of simulations with chaotic behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the additional activity using the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/FlakeMaker' | relative_url }}\">Flake Maker</a> activity with the following three starting shapes:

      Use the results of these three generators as an analogy for how small changes in structure
      cause large changes in cell growth in biology.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does anyone know what predictabilty means?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can anyone explain what chaos means?
    </li>
    <li>
      If I lit a fire in the middle of the room can anyone predict what else would catch on fire?
    </li>
    <li>
      What would influence the way the fire might spread?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about probability and chaos.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about probability and chaos, but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students try the computer version of the

      trees left standing. Allow the students about 20 minutes to explore computer activity.

    <li>
      Lead a class discussion on
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/Chaos' | relative_url }}\">chaos</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the class to think about why the fire activity is not very realistic. Be sure the point
      that controlling the probability of the spread of the fire is out of a person's hands.
      Motivate the next activity by pointing out that if we assume that fire will spread 100% of the
      time, then leaving some empty space in the forest (which a person can control) may keep the
      entire forest from burning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students try the computer version of the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ABetterFire' | relative_url }}\">Better Fire!</a> activity to investigate how large the forest density can be and still consistently have trees
      left standing after a fire.

objectives:
  - "have experimented with several chaotic simulations"
  - "have built a working definition of chaos"
  - "have reinforced their knowledge of basic probability and percents"

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen more ways in which chaos,
  first introduced in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and the Chaos Game</a> lesson, is used to model behavior. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/PascalTriangle' | relative_url }}\">Pascal's Triangle</a> , reintroduces Sierpinski-like Triangles, as seen in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> and
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and the Chaos Game</a> lessons, in yet another way, demonstrating the rich connections between seemingly different kinds
  of math.
