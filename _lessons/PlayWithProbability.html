  Introduce the idea of probability through a discussion that they can relate to. Students may be
  familiar with winning prizes through cereal boxes or soda cans for instance. Students will be able
  to calculate both experimental and theoretical probabilities as well as display probabilities in
  both graphical and fraction form.

  Let the students know what they will be learning and doing today. Say something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Today we are going to explore probability with a number of different activities.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will be moving around the classroom and using the computer today, but for now I would like
    you to remain in your seat with the computer off or closed until I give you further
    instructions.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Work through an example work station with the students.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill out the appropriate section on the with the class.

      Explain the procedures to be followed at each station:
      <p>
        <em>Penny Flip</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Write whether you think the coin is more likely to land on heads or tails and why.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate the theoretical probability.
        </li>
        <li>
          There should be 2 pennies at the station. Each person should flip the penny and record the
          number of times it lands on heads and the number of times it lands on tails.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make a graph representing the results you obtained from the penny flip.

      <em>Spinner</em>
      <ol>
        <li>
          1/4 of the spinner should be red, 1/4 should be green, and 1/2 should be blue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Which color do you think you are more likely to stop on and why?

          Calculate the theoretical probability of landing on each section.
        </li>
