  Using the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ShapeExplorer' | relative_url }}\">Shape Explorer</a> applet, draw a rectangular shape for the students to see. Activate prior knowledge using these
  guiding questions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      How would you find the area of this shape?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there other ways to find the area?

      How do you know that these methods work?

  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, we will be learning about finding the area of irregular shapes.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will be looking for several methods to solve each problem.

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Project an irregular shape on the board.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss with students different ways to find the area of the shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include counting the squares individually as well as breaking the shape into smaller
      rectangular shapes as methods for finding the area.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Project an irregular shape on the board using the Shape Explorer applet.

    <li>
      Have students volunteer to draw outlines of the smaller shapes that compose the bigger shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      Look for at least 3 methods for finding the area for each shape.

  Break the students into groups of three and give them the following instructions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each shape that is projected on the board, your group is to come up with three different
      ways of finding its area.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Area_Explorations_Record_Sheet' | relative_url }}\">record sheet</a>, write down number sentences for those three methods.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  For each shape, give the students a set amount of time to develop methods. Then have the each
  group share their methods to see how many methods the whole class used.
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  Lead the class in a discussion about how they found the area for a given shape. Ask the students
  how the developed new methods of finding the area each time.

objectives:
  - "have practiced finding area of irregular shapes with right angles."
  - "understand that area can be found in multiple ways."
