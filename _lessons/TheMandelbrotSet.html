abstract: "<p>
  The following discussions and activities are designed to lead the students to explore the
  <strong>Mandelbrot Set</strong>. This lesson is designed as a capstone activity for the idea of fractals started in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/InfinityRecursion' | relative_url }}\">Infinity, Self-Similarity, and Recursion</a>,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a>, and
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and the Chaos Game</a> lessons. Students are introduced to the notion of a complex number and function iteration in
  order to motivate the discussion of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is best implemented with students working individually. Allow the students at least 30
  minutes to explore each computer activity.

  This lesson can be enhanced in several ways. However, cutting out any of the discussions or
  activities would limit the student's understanding of the ideas behind the Mandelbrot set.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add the additional task of trying to find an image that looks like an actual object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a contest in which the students are asked to find the most interesting image, with a
      panel of teachers or the entire class being the judge. (Have the students print out their
      images so that a display can be set up.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If connected to the internet, use the enhanced version of the software,
      <link href=\"http://www.shodor.org/master/fractal/software/mandy\">The Fractal Microscope</a>, to explore the Mandelbrot set more fully.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does anyone remember what a fractal is?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are some fractals that we have looked at thus far?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn to calculate complex number functions and see how these
      fumctions lead to the creation of fractals such as the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about complex number functions, but please do not
      turn your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity
      first.

  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen how the Mandelbrot set is
  built for the simple case of quadratic functions. This set has many number-theoretic properties
  which can be explored. For future reading on this complex and beautiful topic see:
