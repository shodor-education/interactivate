  If there is only one computer, this lesson can be modified in the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The teacher can prepare problems by given students various starting and ending times. The
      students can then discuss methods for finding elapsed time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Students who need additional help can use the applet after completing the problems on paper.

  Open the lesson with this question, replacing times to make it more authentic:
  <ul>
    <li>
      We started math at 10 a.m. It is now 11 a.m. How long have we been doing math?
    </li>
    <li>
      What do we call this time?
    </li>

    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn what elapsed time is and how to calculate it.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to do this but please do not turn your computers on until I
      ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

    <li>
      Open your browser to the
