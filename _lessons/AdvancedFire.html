abstract: "<p>
  The following lesson is designed to help students explore the real-world implications of functions
  and independent/dependent variables. This lesson is best implemented with students working in
  teams of 2, alternating between the \"experimenter\" and \"recorder\" using the computer activities.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If only one computer is available, choose an experiment as a class and have each student or
      group make predictions about the relationship between independent and dependent variables.
      Then, conduct the experiment on an overhead projector to test your hypotheses.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What does it mean to say that something is independent?
    </li>
    <li>
      What, then, do you think an
      <strong>independent variable</strong> is?
    </li>
    <li>
      What does it mean to say that something is dependent?
    </li>
    <li>
      What, then, do you think a
      <strong>dependent variable</strong> is?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about independent and dependent variables
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about independent/dependent variables through a
      real-world experiment, but please do not turn your computers on until I ask you to. I want to
      show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  Lead a discussion to prepare the students to identify independent and dependent variables in the
  Advanced Fire applet. Ask questions such as the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the real world, why is it important to know which variables are independent and which are
      dependent?
    </li>
    <li>
      How can we know if the dependent variable really depends on the independent variable?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Introduce the concept of inputs and outputs. Discuss the relationship between independent
  variables (inputs) and dependent variables (outputs), especially in the context of
  experimentation. Ask questions such as the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      If there are multiple inputs, how do you determine a relationship between just one independent
      variable and the dependent variables (outputs)?
    </li>
    <li>
      What does it mean to \"control\" the inputs?
    </li>
    <li>
      Who determines the independent variable in an experiment?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Demonstrate how to use the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdvancedFire' | relative_url }}\">Advanced Fire</a> applet. Be sure to demonstrate the following tasks:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Setting and changing the probability that fire will spread.
    </li>
    <li>
      Setting a tree on fire and watching the fire spread.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reviewing the result of past burns with the Burn History button.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Discuss the fact that Advanced Fire has multiple variables. Ask the following questions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Are there any variables in this scenario?
    </li>
    <li>
      How do you know?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are they?
    </li>
    <li>
      Which variables do you set and which are determined by the applet itself?
    </li>
    <li>
      Which of these variables are the independent variables? The dependent variables?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Have the students try the computer version of the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdvancedFire' | relative_url }}\">Advanced Fire</a> activity to investigate the relationship between Burn Probability and the actual proportion of
  trees left standing.
</p>
<p>
  Divide students into groups of 2-3 and ask them to choose a topic related to Advanced Fire to
  investigate that involves controlling independent variables and measuring their effect on
  dependent variables. Students should then fill out the
  <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Advanced_Fire_Worksheet' | relative_url }}\">worksheet</a> for their chosen topic.
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Ask students to
  identify their chosen independent and dependent variables, and then describe the relationship that
  they found between the two. Ask the following questions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      What is one way to easily identify the independent variable(s) in a problem? The dependent
      variable(s)?
    </li>
    <li>
      Did every group that performed the same experiment get the same results? What does that tell
      you about the randomness of the burning?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
objectives:
  - "understand the correlation between independent and dependent variables in real-world situations"
  - "understand the importance of identifying and manipulating independent and dependent variables to determine causation"

      - "understand the concepts of fractions and decimals"
      - "understand and manipulate basic probabilities"

      - "perform basic mouse manipulations such as point, click and drag"
      - "use a browser for experimenting with the activities"
subjects:

  - "Modeling"
suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  These discussions and experiments will have given students a greater understanding of independent
  and dependent variables and their use in quasi-real-world situations. To follow up on this lesson,
  consider having students conduct more complex experiments with
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/DirectableFire' | relative_url }}\">Directable Fire!!</a> or
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ABetterFire' | relative_url }}\">A Better Fire!!</a>, where students have to consider variability in direction as well as proportion.
