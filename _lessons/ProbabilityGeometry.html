abstract: "<p>
  The activity and two discussions of this lesson connect probability and geometry. The Polyhedra
  discussion leads to platonic solids, and the Probability and Geometry discussion leads to
  connections between angles, areas and probability. The subtle difference between defining
  probability by counting outcomes and defining probability by measuring proportions of geometrical
  characteristics is brought to light.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students construct spinners out of several different materials, and then compare the
      results they obtain. Which materials or designs produce spinners that produce more truly
      \"random\" results? Compare the results of many spins with these spinners with the
      computer-generated results from the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BasicSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Spinner Game</a> and the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdjustableSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Adjustable Spinner Game</a> to show students the advantage of using a computer model to produce accurate results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Buffon' | relative_url }}\">Buffon's Needle</a> as an additional example of the connection between probability and geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have groups of students read the two discussions in this lesson and prepare presentations for
      their classmates that explain the content of the discussions.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Who has ever watched the game Wheel of Fortune?
    </li>
    <li>
      Have you ever noticed when they put the $10,000 space on the wheel it is significantly smaller
      than the rest of the spaces?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do you think size of the space affects whether or not you will land on the space?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to begin learning about probability.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about probability, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/FromGeometryToProbab' | relative_url }}\">Probability and Geometry</a> discussion shows that sometimes knowledge of geometry is required to answer probability
      questions.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BasicSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Spinner Game</a> and the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdjustableSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Adjustable Spinner Game</a> to demonstrate probability concepts using spinners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each student or group of students can construct a spinner or use the software to construct a
      \"virtual spinner.\" Conducting multiple experiments with the spinners, students can determine
      experimentally the chances of selecting each sector, and compare these chances.
    </li>
    <li>
      If students use physical spinners, they will have to tally the results of the experiments by
      hand. Each group of students can use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/203.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Spinner Experiments Table</a> for that.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using spinners, physical or virtual, from the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BasicSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Spinner Game</a> and the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/AdjustableSpinner' | relative_url }}\">Adjustable Spinner Game</a> , groups of students can discuss how to find the exact probability of selecting each sector
      on their spinner, and then compare their findings with experimental data from the Spinner
      Game. The following questions can help the students:
      <ol>
        <li>
          What features of the spinner (e.g., size, color of sectors, etc.) make a difference for
          the probability, and what features do not make a difference?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we decide which of the two sectors has a better chance to be selected? Can we do
          it without cutting the spinner and superimposing the sectors?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      The
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/Polyhedra' | relative_url }}\">Polyhedra</a> discussion connects probability and geometry through construction of dice with various
      numbers of sides.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Have students construct their own dice. We can loosely call a
  <strong>die</strong> a 3-D object that can land in several different ways when it is rolled on a flat surface. Most
  people are familiar with six-sided dice. The following activities and questions can be interesting
  to individual students or to groups of students:
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Come up with a way to construct a \"die\" that has as many sides as you want, starting from 3:
      3, 4, 5, 100, ... Hint: pencil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using the following rules, try to construct various dice:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can use polygons of only one type: either equilateral triangles or squares or regular
          pentagons
        </li>
        <li>
          Each vertex of the die has the same number of sides connected to it. In practice, you can
          start from forming one vertex out of several polygons. Their number will be dictated by
          geometry (3, 4 or 5 for triangles, 3 for squares, 3 for pentagons). Then attach the same
          number of sides to the remaining vertices, finishing the polyhedron.
        </li>
        <li>
          The dice that can be constructed this way are called platonic solids.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Can you construct a platonic solid type die out of regular hexagons? Why or why not? Try it.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.

          cardboard or plastic forms of equilateral triangles, squares, and regular pentagons to

          squares, and 15-20 pentagons is available, then forms and scissors are unnecessary.

      The
