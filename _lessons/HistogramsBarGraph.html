abstract: "<p>
  The goal of this lesson is to introduce histograms, bar graphs and the concept of class interval.
  An activity and three discussions with supplemental exercises help students learn how data can be
  graphically represented (and mis-represented). Students will learn to distinguish between bar
  graphs and histograms and to use each in the appropriate situations.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instead of initiating class discussions, have the students read the discussions independently,
      and then see how well they understood by having them complete the sample problems worksheets
      that accompany each discussion.
    </li>
    <li>
      For further investigation into the representation of data, and to practice working with
      fractions and decimals, students can work with

  Remind students of what they have learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this
  lesson and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What are some different ways to represent data?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is there one way that is superior to all the others?

  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about the differences between bar graphs and histograms.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about the differences between bar graphs and
      histograms, but please do not turn your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a
      little about these activities first.

    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use the

      importance of vertical scale in bar graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Histogram' | relative_url }}\">Histogram</a> activity to demonstrate the importance of class interval size and vertical scale in
      histograms.

    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead a class discussion about
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/ClassInterval' | relative_url }}\">Class Intervals</a> to deepen and formalize students' intuitive understanding of histograms, bar graphs, and
      class intervals. Use
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/160.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Sample Problems on Bar Graph Scales</a> to provide examples for the discussion. Students can read the sample problems and try to
      solve them individually or in groups, or use them as examples and create their own statistics
      problems for themselves and/or for other students.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, initiate a discussion based on
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/VerticalScaleDiscuss' | relative_url }}\">Vertical Scale</a> to enhance the students' understanding of how data can be represented graphically.

    <li>
      To bring together ideas introduced in the lesson so far, the
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/HistogramsVsBarGraph' | relative_url }}\">Histogram vs. Bar Graphs Discussion</a> will help students to compare the properties of histograms and bar graphs.
