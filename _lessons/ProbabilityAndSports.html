abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is devoted to Internet research on a specific topic: finding topics in sports where
  probability is relevant. The goal of the lesson is to introduce some statistics and probability
  concepts by looking at practical questions that arise in professional sports.

      For an introduction to the difference between probability and statistics, students can read

    content: "<p>
  Remind students of what they learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How many of you like to play sports?
    </li>
    <li>
      When you are getting ready to play a game, are there some teams that you know your team can
      beat easier than others?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn how probability applies to sports.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about applying probability to sports, but please do
      not turn your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity
      first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Review some basic probability facts and explain to the students what they will be doing.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have each person or group decide which sport they would like to research and monitor them as
      they begin their searches.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can suggest people search for probability information in the web sites related to the
      following sports:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/202.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Golf</a> links
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/201.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Soccer</a> links
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/198.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Baseball</a> links
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/199.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Basketball</a> links
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students search one of the four sports provided (or find information about a different
      sport, if desired) to find connections between the sport and probability. Each student or
      group of students can find and then share a piece of information about chances to win against
      a particular player or team, chances to make a \"hole in one\" in golf, chances of making a
      basket in basketball, or anything else connected with probability that they may find on these
      sports pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Search for answers to specific questions. Each student or group of students can come up with
      specific questions concerning sports, and try to find answers using Internet resources. These
      <link metaid=\"1318\">sample questions about golf</a> can be used as examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      Sports challenge: \"Do you believe it?\" Students or groups of students find pieces of
      probability information on sports, and then challenge another group to confirm or refute their
      data. Students do not necessarily give the correct answer, making the activity more
      interesting. For example, having found that the record drive for a long drive in a golf
      contest is 448 yards, the students may challenge another group: \"Is it true that the record
      drive is above 470 yards?\" Students can give hints, for example, the address of the website
      where they have found the information.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
    </li>
  </ul>

  - category: "Arithmetic"
    prereqs:
      - "relate the sports information they collect to mathematical expression"
      - "use simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division when working with the sports information they collect"
  - category: "Technological"

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After this lesson, the students will have seen practical applications of how probability is used
  in everyday situations such as sports. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/IdeasLeadProbability' | relative_url }}\">Ideas That Lead to Probability</a>, introduces ideas that are the basis of probability theory. By using everyday experiences and
  intuitive understanding, this lesson gives students a gradual introduction to probability.
  Students will work with random number generators and learn what it means for a game to be fair.
