  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Omit one or the other of the computer activities to reduce the amount of time spent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a discussion about fractional movement on the coordinate plane
    </li>

      For students who aren't ready to handle negative numbers yet, replace the Coordinates activity

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about graphing lines on the coordinate plane.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to do this but please do not turn your computers on until I
      ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Practice the students' point plotting skills by having them play the
