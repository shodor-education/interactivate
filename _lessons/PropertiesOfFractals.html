  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Leave out all references to logarithms, using only trial and error for finding the fractal
      dimensions. This reduces the required time significantly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add an additional discussion session: Build a class list of all the fractals whose dimensions
      have been calculated in order by size of dimension, and have students use the pictures as
      evidence for why this ordering makes sense visually.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does anyone remember what a fractal is?
    </li>
    <li>
      What are some fractals that we have looked at thus far?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about dimensions and how to calculate fractal dimensions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about fractal dimensions, but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

objectives:
  - "have built a working definition of regular fractal"
  - "have looked carefully at the concepts of dimension and scale"
  - "have been introduced to the concept of logarithms"
  - "have solved simple exponential equations for the exponent both by trial and error and using logs"
student-prerequisites:
  - category: "Geometric"
    prereqs:
      - "recognize and sketch objects such as lines, rectangles, triangles, and squares"
      - "understand the basic notion of Euclidean dimension"
      - "measure figures to find the scale factor in similar objects"
  - category: "Algebraic"
    prereqs:
      - "understand formulas involving exponents"
  - category: "Technological"
    prereqs:
      - "perform basic mouse manipulations such as point, click and drag"
      - "use a browser for experimenting with the activities"
subjects:
  - "Discrete"
  - "Geometry"
  - "Number and Operations"
suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the student will have a basic definition of regular
  fractals and will have seen the method for calculating fractal dimensions for fractals such as
  those explored in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/InfinityRecursion' | relative_url }}\">Infinity, Self-Similarity, and Recursion</a>,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a>, and
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and the Chaos Game</a> lessons. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/Chaos' | relative_url }}\">Chaos</a>, delves deeper into the notion of Chaos introduced in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and the Chaos Game</a> lesson. An alternate follow-up lesson would be the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/IrregularFractals' | relative_url }}\">Irregular Fractals</a> lesson, in which the students learn how the notion of calculating fractal dimension is much more
  difficult with irregular fractals.
