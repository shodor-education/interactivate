 		Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:</p><p>
 		<ul>
 		<li>Ask students if anyone knows what a factor is</li>
 		<li>Using either the defintion a student gives, or one you provide yourself, ask if anyone knows what it means to factorize a number.</li>

    content: "<p>
 		Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:</p><p>
 		<ul>
 		<li>Today, class, we will be talking about factors</li>
 		<li>We are going to use the computers to learn about factors, but please do not turn your computers on or go to this page until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.</li>

  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
 		<ul>
 		<li>Explain to the students how to do the assignment. You should model or demonstrate it for the students, especially if they are not familiar with how to use our computer applets.</li>
 		<li>Open your browser to <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Factorize' | relative_url }}\">Factorize</a>  in order to demonstrate this activity to the students.</li>

    content: "<p>
 		<ul>
 		<li>Work through the first few questions on the <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/25.pdf' | relative_url }}\">Factorize Questions</a> worksheet and then let them finish it on their own.</li>
 		<li>When you begin using the Factorize activity you may want to have students take turns giving answers to the problems and work through one or two games as a class until students are ready to try it on their own </li>

  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
 		<ul>
