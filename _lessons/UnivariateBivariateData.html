abstract: "<p>
  The following lesson is designed to introduce students to the differentiation between univariate
  and bivariate data. Students will gain experience determining what types of graphs and measures
  are appropriate for each type of data.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is designed for students who are familiar with graphs and measures related to
  univariate data, even if they don't know the vocabulary term.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is designed for students who are familiar with Shodor applets, particularly

  Ask students to brainstorm ideas about what univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data might be.
  Explain to students that they have already dealt with univariate data without using that
  vocabulary term.

    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Today we are going to discover the differences between two types of data: univariate and
    bivariate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once we learn about the differences between these types of data, we will determine the
    appropriate graphs and measures for each type of data.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will use the computers later, but please do not open them until I instruct you to do so.
