abstract: "<p>
  This activity is designed to further the work of the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> lesson by showing students how the Sierpinski triangle can arise from seemingly totally unrelated
  sources. This gives the students an appreciation of the interconnections of different kinds of
  mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  This lesson is best started on paper with each student working individually. Plan on 10-15 minutes
  for individual exploration. Then allow the students to work individually or in small groups to
  explore the computer activity. Plan on an hour for the complete set of computer activities, with
  additional time for discussion.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Combine just the triangle version of these activities with those in the
      <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> lesson to give a simple introduction to the Sierpinski triangle and fractals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine the triangle version of this activity with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> and
      <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/PascalTriangle' | relative_url }}\">Pascal's Triangle</a> lessons to give a comprehensive introduction to the Sierpinski triangle by examining three
      separate ways in which this figure can be generated.

    <li>
      If connected to the internet, use the enhanced version of the software,
      <link href=\"http://www.shodor.org/MASTER/fractal/software/Sierpinski.html\">Sierpinski Gasket Maker</a> , to explore generalizations to the Sierpinski shapes in which the user can specify both a
      movement probability and a rotation.

  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson,
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does anyone remember what a fractal is?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can any one explain what the word pattern means?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can someone explain what the word random means?
    </li>
    <li>
      Who thinks that seemingly random process can result in a pattern?

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn how a seemingly random process can result in a familiar
      pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about patterns, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before you say anything, place three large dots on the board so that they represent the
      corners of an equilateral triangle. Lable the dots A , B, and C. Explain to the class that you
      are going to start at a random place on the board, place a dot, and call on them one by one to
      have them choose A, B, or C. Then, place a small dot half way between the last dot drawn and
      the corner called out by the student.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once everyone has had a chance to call out a corner, ask the class if anyone sees a pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask what the class thinks will happen if this process is continued for a really long time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explain to the class that the process they were just doing is how
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}\">The Chaos Game</a> works.
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students try the computer version of the basic (triangle)
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}\">Chaos Game</a>. Place 20 dots at a time for as many iterations as necessary for them to recognize
      Sierpinski's Triangle forming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lead a
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/ProbabilityAndOutcom' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a> on basic probability to prepare the students for their independent practice.

  </ul>

  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students try changing the probabilities (which can be explained as movement ratios)
      for various starting shapes with the computer version of the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}\">Chaos Game</a>, making and testing conjectures about the final shapes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students record what they plan to change the probability to, what they expect to
      happen, and what actually happens.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you choose, you may also pass out the worksheet that accompanies this applet and have the
      students complete it at this time.

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen that the Sierpinski's Carpet
  and Sierpinski's Gasket explored in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> lesson also appear from playing
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/TheChaosGame' | relative_url }}\">The Chaos Game</a>. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/PropertiesOfFractals' | relative_url }}\">Properties of Fractals</a>, is a capstone lesson designed to summarize and formalize the notion of a fractal now that the
  students have seen several different kinds. An alternate follow-up lesson would be the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/PascalTriangle' | relative_url }}\">Pascal's Triangle</a> lesson, in which the Sierpinski Triangle appears again from a different source (namely, Pascal's
  Triangle).
