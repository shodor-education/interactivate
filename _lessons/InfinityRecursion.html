abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is designed to get students to think about several of the concepts from fractals,
  including recursion and self similarity. The mathematical concepts of line segments, perimeter,
  area and infinity are used, and skill at pattern recognition is practiced.
</p>
<p>
  The fractals generated here all start with simple curves made from line segments. They display the
  curiosities that intrigued the mathematicians looking at infinity at the turn of the century. The
  Hilbert curves demonstrate that a seemingly 1 dimensional curve can fill a 2-d space, and the Koch
  snowflake demonstrates that a 1-d curve can be infinitely long and surround a finite area.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose fewer of the activities to cover; for example, covering Cantor's comb, the Hilbert
      curve and the Koch snowflake still allows for discussion of infinity, self-similarity and
      recursion.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have different groups of students do different activities and give group presentations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leave out one or more of the concept discussions and focus on pattern recognition and
      fractions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students draw several steps of each of the activities by hand before trying the
      computerized version. Graph paper and rulers would be needed for this. Plan on an additional
      10-15 minutes per activity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine this lesson with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> lesson, to give the students a well rounded picture of regular fractals, including a formal
      definition.
    </li>
    <li>
      If connected to the internet, use the enhanced version of the software,
      <link href=\"http://www.shodor.org/MASTER/fractal/software/Snowflake.html\">Snowflake</a>, to explore line deformation fractals more fully.

    <li>
      Describe the

      steps of the race, stopping when they think they see what is happening.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have students run several steps of the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/CantorComb' | relative_url }}\">Cantor's Comb</a>. The students should look at the patterns made by the lengths of the segments and the total
      length. It may take drawing two or three iterations before the number pattern becomes obvious.

      Repeat the previous exercise for

      large change in the final object.

    <li>
      Repeat the previous exercise for the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/KochSnowflake' | relative_url }}\">Koch's Curve</a> , this time also asking about patterns in the area enclosed as well as the length of the
      curve.
