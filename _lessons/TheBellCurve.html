abstract: "<p>
  The goal of this lesson is to introduce the concepts of the normal curve, skewness and the
  standard deviation. The controversy over the 1994 book is also examined.

    <li>
      Look at the normal distribution without discussing the bell curve controversy. This saves time
      and avoids controversial material.
    </li>
    <li>
      Relate the histograms produced by the normal and skew distributions to the idea of finding
      area under a curve by counting the rectangles that fit under it (simple graphical numerical
      integration). Use the grid and the scale on the normal distribution to find the area under the
      normal curve. (It should be close to 1).

  Let students know what they will be learning and doing today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today we are going to be looking at one specific way that mathematicians and statisticians
      look at data: the bell curve. We will be examining what this representation is and the
      controversy behind it.

    <li>
      We will be using the computer and Internet later, but for now I want you to keep the computer
      closed.

objectives:
  - "have been introduced to the normal distribution"
  - "have an understanding of how the normal distribution has been used and misused to support conclusions"
student-prerequisites:
  - category: "Arithmetic"
    prereqs:
      - "Students should understand sums, differences, and quotients for all activities."
  - category: "Geometric"
    prereqs:
      - "Students will need to understand both the concept of area in general and, specifically, the area of a rectangle."
  - category: "Technology"
    prereqs:
      - "Each student or group of students working together will need a computer with a web browser. Students should be comfortable using the computer and browser. Calculators may be helpful for solving problems that arise in discussions."
subjects:
  - "Statistics"
suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  This lesson introduced the notion of the normal curve and illustrated a real life (mis)use of the
  statistics drawn from a given situation. Revisiting the initial lessons on
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/StatisticsShopping' | relative_url }}\">Statistics and Shopping</a> and
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/ProbabilityAndSports' | relative_url }}\">Probability and Sports</a> and applying the new knowledge on statistics would make an excellent capstone activity.
</p>"
teacher-preparation: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Students will need access to a web browser.
    </li>
    <li>
      Students will need pencil and paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Students will need copies of the following worksheets:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/398.pdf' | relative_url }}\">The Normal Distribution activity</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/69.pdf' | relative_url }}\">The Skew Distribution activity</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Especially if doing the Bell Curve sections \"live\", the instructor should have some
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/178.pdf' | relative_url }}\">background on the bell curve</a> .
