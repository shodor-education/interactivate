  This lesson can be rearranged if there is only one available computer.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instead of having students complete Record Sheet in pairs, display the
      <strong>Compute</strong> mode on a classroom computer, record the dimensions on the whiteboard, and have students work
      independently to solve for the volume. When students have computed the volume, have one
      student enter the number to check answer.

  - heading: "Focus and Review"
    content: "<p>
  Remind students what has been covered in previous lessons and have students review the following:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Area of shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles, etc)
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic concept of volume
    </li>
    <li>
      Volume of rectangular prisms
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today we are going to be extending our discussion from yesterday about volume. Instead of
      looking at the volume of rectangular prisms, we are going to be generalizing the process for
      all prisms.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will continue to use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/SurfaceAreaAndVolume' | relative_url }}\">Surface Area and Volume</a> applet, but please don't open your computers until I instruct you to do so.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead students in a
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/FindingVolumeTriangular' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a> about a generalized approach to finding the volume of all prisms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be prepared to show students physical models of different prisms and identify the base shape.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Introduce
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/SurfaceAreaAndVolume' | relative_url }}\">Surface Area and Volume</a> applet to any students who are unfamiliar with the applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure that students are using
      <em>Triangular Prism</em> from the drop-down menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      Before students begin working on the applet, be sure to point out the Slant Height component
      on the applet and explain that this measurement is not necessary for today's activity.
    </li>
    <li>
      Note: If students will be using the
      <strong>Compute</strong> mode for finding only the volume of the prisms and not the Surface Area and Slant Height,
      show the students the pop-up box that will appear indicating that the Surface Area input is
      incorrect.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have students open
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/SurfaceAreaAndVolume' | relative_url }}\">Surface Area and Volume</a> applet to
      <strong>Compute</strong> mode and choose
      <strong>Triangular Prism</strong> from the drop-down menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      Students should work in pairs to complete the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/VolTriPrismRecordSheet' | relative_url }}\">Volume of a Triangular Prism Record Sheet</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Teacher should monitor the room for questions and make sure that students are on the correct
      website.

  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may wish to bring the class back together to discuss any problems that were especially
      hard for students to solve. Once the students have been allowed to share what they found,
      summarize once more the main points of the lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also ask students to brainstorm definitions for surface area as a lead in to future
      lessons.
