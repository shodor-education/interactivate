  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Inform students that foresters use probability when setting what are known as controlled burns.  In order to do a controlled burn, foresters need to be able to model the forest burning.  They do this by assigning a certain burn probability to each tree.  The burn probability depends on a variety of climatic conditions. </li>
  		</ul>

  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Have the students draw four 5x5 squares on a sheet of graph paper.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students to draw a triangle inside of each block in the 5x5 squares</li>
  		<li>Explain to the students that the triangles represent trees.</li>
  		<li>Also make sure the students understand that only trees directly on top of, beneath, to the left and to the right of an already burning tree can catch on fire.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students that the trees in the first 5x5 square have a 1/6 probability of catching on fire after the center tree has been set on fire.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students that the trees in the second 5x5 square have a 1/3 probability of catching on fire after the center tree has been set on fire.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students that the trees in the third 5x5 square have a 1/2 probability of catching on fire after the center tree has been set on fire.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students that the trees in the fourth 5x5 square have a 2/3 probability of catching on fire after the center tree has been set on fire.</li>
  		<li>Have the students use dice to decide wether or not each tree touching the burning tree catches on fire.  For example, if a tree has a 1/2 probability to catch on fire then it will burn on rolls of  1, 2, and 3 and not burn on rolls of 4, 5, and 6.</li>
  		<li>Work through one model on the board as a class</li>
  		<li>After you have completed the burn, show the students how to calculate the percent burn.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Have the students work through all four of their forests.</li>
  		<li>Monitor the students. </li>
  		<li>As they finish have them open up the
  		<a href=\"{{ '/activities/Fire' | relative_url }}\">Fire Applet</a>  and do several burns with the burn probabilities they modeled using dice, pencil, and paper.</li>
  		<li>After all the students have had a chance to work through their models on paper, write all the percent burns on the board in columns under their corresponding burn probability.</li>
  		<li>Ask the students why they think there is such a large variation in percent burns for certain probabilities and such a small variation for others.</li>
  		<li>Have the students use the <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Fire' | relative_url }}\">Fire Applet</a> to try to figure out which probability is most unpredictable.</li>
  		<li>Ask the students if any of them can think of a way to model a burn if when the wind is blowing in a certain direction.  (Set higher probabilities in the direction the wind is blowing while setting lower probabilities in the opposite direction of the wind.)</li>
  		<li>Have the students open the <a href=\"{{ '/activities/DirectableFire' | relative_url }}\">Directable Fire Applet</a>.</li>
  		<li>Tell the students to try experimenting with the applet to see how they might manipulate the burn probabilities to model the effects that wind might have on a burning forest.</li>
  		<li>Monitor the students' progress and have a couple of the students share their model with the class</li>
  		</ul>
  	</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  		<ul>
  		<li>Draw connections between the probability that each tree will catch on fire and the percent of trees burned</li>
  		<li>Be sure to point out that a 1/2 probability a tree will catch on fire does not imply that 50% of the trees will burn.</li>
  		<li>Point out that it was much quicker and easier to model forest
  		burns on a computer rather than by hand.</li>
