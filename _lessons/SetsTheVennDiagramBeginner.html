  This lesson is designed to introduce students to the idea of a set and what it means to be a part
  of a set. Students will experiment with sets in conjunction with the Venn Diagram activity.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways if only one computer is available for the classroom:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The teacher may do this activity as a demonstration, using only one computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    While demonstrating, the teacher can engage students by asking individuals or groups where each
    shape belongs.
  </li>
  <li>
    After students are familiar with how to use Venn diagrams, have students work in groups or
    independently to answer the questions on the
    <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Worksheet_for_Sets_and_the_Venn_Diagram_Beginner' | relative_url }}\">worksheet</a>.
  </li>
</ul>"
key-terms:
  - "element"
  - "set"

  Introduce students to the concept of grouping and sets. Consider leading students in a discussion:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The
    <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/SetsBeginner' | relative_url }}\">elementary sets discussion</a> introduces the idea of sets and commonalities among elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    To ensure understanding, ask students guiding questions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        What is an element that you use everyday?
      </li>
      <li>
        What set is this element part of?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>"
  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we will be talking about sets and what it means to be an element in a set.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about sets and Venn diagrams, but please do not
      turn your computers on or go to this page until I ask you to. I want to first show you a
      little about sets and Venn diagrams.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  Lead the students in a short discussion about
  <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/VennDiagramBeginner' | relative_url }}\">Venn diagrams</a>.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask students how Venn diagrams are related to sets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explain to the class that Venn diagrams can be used to sort different sets, even if the sets
      do not contain shapes or numbers.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Open your browser to the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ShapeSorter' | relative_url }}\">Venn Diagram Shape Sorter</a> applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Begin showing students how to use the applet by doing an example using a color for one circle
      and a shape for the other.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow students to complete the example as a class by giving answers orally. Be sure that
      students explain why their answer is correct.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Allow students to work independently or in pairs with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ShapeSorter' | relative_url }}\">Venn Diagram Shape Sorter</a> for approximately 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once students have used the applet, have students complete the
      <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Worksheet_for_Sets_and_the_Venn_Diagram_Beginner' | relative_url }}\">worksheet</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead the class in a discussion to compare their answers to the questions on the worksheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students guiding questions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          How do Venn diagrams help you understand sets and intersections?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you think it's easier to find the intersection of two sets when you use a Venn diagram?
          Why do you think that?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
