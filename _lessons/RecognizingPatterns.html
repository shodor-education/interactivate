      After the class is seated, ask them to follow along with what you are about to do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Begin rotating between patting your legs and clapping your hands: pat, clap, pat, clap, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the entire class is following along, ask someone to raise their hand and tell the class
      how they knew what to do.

    <li>
      Ask students if anyone else has a different answer. The answer you are looking for will
      contain the word \"pattern\".

    <li>
      Tell the students to join in and follow along as soon as they know what you are doing.

      Begin: clap, pat, tap (on a desk), clap, pat, tap, clap, etc.

  <ul>
    <li>
      If the students have not already mentioned the word \"pattern\", tell them that the exercise
      they just finished contained various patterns.

    <li>
      Ask the class if anyone can come up with a different type of pattern that doesn't involve
      movement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call several students to the front of the class and have them share the beginning of their
      patterns with the class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the class if anyone can complete the patterns provided by their classmates.
    </li>
    <li>
      If none of the students think of any shape patterns place a few of them on the board and have
      the students complete the patterns.

      Instruct the students to spend about 3-5 minutes playing with the

    </li>
    <li>
      After they have had a few minutes to become familiar with the applet, ask if anyone knows what
      the applet is doing.

          Did anyone notice any patterns created by the applet?

      Have the students take out a sheet of paper, extend the following number sequences, and

      Direct the students to complete the sequences provided. You may want to have the students copy
      a few lines of the computer generated patterns to ensure each student is on task.

      Now, instruct the students to open the

    <li>
      Once the students have created their sequences, have them swap the number sequences with a
