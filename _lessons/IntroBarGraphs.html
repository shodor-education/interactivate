  For younger students, you may want to hand them a bag of shapes and have them create a bar graph
  similar to those found in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BarGraphSorter' | relative_url }}\">Bar Graph Shape Sorter</a> applet, rather than having them survey the class and creating a bar graph using the
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}\">Bar Graph</a> applet.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Begin by calling on each student in the class and asking what color his/her eyes are.
    </li>
    <li>
      As each student answers make a tally mark by the appropriate color.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask the students to arrange the information displayed on the board in a way that it is easy to
      read on a sheet of paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the students' progress.
    </li>

  Students will:
  <ul>
    <li>
      practice making bar graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      be able to interpret bar graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      ask a question, collect data about that question, and create a bar graph to answer their
      question.
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Congratulate the students on their efforts.
    </li>
    <li>
      If any student happens to arrange their information in a bar graph-like-manner use his/her
      graph as an example.
    </li>
    <li>
      If not, explain to the students that some people choose to arrange their data in what is known
      as a bar graph.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explain the term bar graph.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explain how to arrange data using a bar graph.

  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students help you arrange the data located on the board into a bar graph.
    </li>
    <li>
      Describe to the students how to use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BarGraphSorter' | relative_url }}\">Bar Graph Shape Sorter</a> applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instruct the students to run through several sets of shapes to get a feel for the program.
    </li>
    <li>
      Record information about the types of pants people are wearing (Pants, jeans, dresses, or
      shorts).
    </li>
    <li>
      Instruct the students on how to use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}\">Bar Graph</a> applet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/BarGraph' | relative_url }}\">Bar Graph</a> applet to graph the data collected about what type of pants people in the class wear.

  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Instruct the kids to come up with a question they would like to answer by surveying their
      classmates.
    </li>
    <li>
      You may want to give them a few sample questions to choose from if they cannot come up with
      one on their own:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shoe Size
        </li>
        <li>
          Birth Month

        <li>
          Favorite Book
        </li>
        <li>
          Favorite Television Show
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students question their classmates and then create a bar graph either on paper or by
      using the Bar Graph applet
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Closure"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Choose several students to share their bar graphs with the class.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover all pertinent vocabulary.
    </li>
  </ul>
