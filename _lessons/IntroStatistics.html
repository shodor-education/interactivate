abstract: "<p>
  The goal of this lesson is to introduce the concepts of mean, median and mode and to develop
  understanding and familiarity with these ideas. The
  <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Measures' | relative_url }}\">Measures Activity</a> lets students explore mean and median in an efficient way; the Mean, Median and Mode Discussion
  helps them to formalize their knowledge.

  Remind students of what they have learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this
  lesson and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Does anyone know what \"average\" means?

  - heading: "Objectives"
    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about mean, median, and mode.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about mean,median, and mode, but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Lead a
      <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/MeanMedianAndMode' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a>, or the instructor can prepare a \"live\" discussion, to deepen and formalize the students'
      intuitive understanding of mean, median, and mode. (10-20 min)

  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Introduce and develop the concepts of mean and median with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Measures' | relative_url }}\">Measures</a> activity. Students will change parameters and discover patterns related to mean and median.
      Students can choose their own focus of measure, their own quantity, and their own units. (20

      Have the students either individually or in groups read and try to solve

      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the

objectives:
  - "understand three different measures of \"center\""
  - "have been exposed to multiple ways of expressing a set of numbers"
  - "have practiced their arithmetic skills"
student-prerequisites:
  - category: "Arithmetic"
    prereqs:
      - "sums, differences, and quotients for all activities."
  - category: "Technological"
    prereqs:
      - "Each student or group of students working together will need a computer with a web browser. Students should be comfortable using the computer and browser. Calculators may be helpful for solving problems that arise in discussions."
subjects:
  - "Statistics"
suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  This lesson introduced the students to some basic ways of describing sets of data. The next
  lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/HistogramsBarGraph' | relative_url }}\">Histograms and Bar Graphs</a>, introduces histograms, bar graphs, and the concept of class interval. Students will learn to
  distinguish between bar graphs and histograms and to use each in the appropriate situations.
