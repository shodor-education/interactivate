  Begin the lesson by asking the students if anyone has a fenced yard and ask them to think about
  how you might figure out how much fencing was required.

  Let student know what they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Today we are going to be learning about the concept of perimeter and how to calculate perimeter.
  </li>
  <li>
    We are going to use the computers to learn about perimeter, but please do not turn your
    computers on or go to this page until I ask you to.
  </li>
</ul>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the class measure the perimeter of their desk top using their hands as the unit of
      measure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss the different answers the students calculated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why the answers differed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Introduce the term perimeter.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work in pairs and measure the perimeter of 4 or 5 different objects around
      the room using different units: hands, feet, pencils, in, ft, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monitor the students' progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a couple of students share their examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why it might be necessary to have a standard unit like: inches, feet, or meters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss why someone might need to know the perimeter of something. (Example: fencing a yard)
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how to use the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}\">Perimeter Explorer</a>. (You may want to specify certain area settings.) Have the students answer a couple of
      computer generated problems with you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how to draw the figure generated by the computer on a piece of graph paper.
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students work either alone or in groups of two with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/PerimeterExplorer' | relative_url }}\">Perimeter Explorer</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      So you can check their progress, have the students copy the computer generated figures on a
      piece of graph paper.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Draw a grid on the board and draw a few shapes in the grid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call on several different students to help you determine the perimeter of each shape.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the meaning of the word perimeter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the different units used to measure perimeter.
