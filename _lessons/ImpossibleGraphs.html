abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is devoted to impossible graphs. Users of the module can learn to distinguish between
  possible and impossible graphs of functions, and to learn why some graphs are impossible. These
  activities together give a brief lesson that can be completed in as little as 30 minutes
  class-time, depending on how many teams need to share their ideas. The discovery process takes
  about 15 minutes, and each presentation about 5 minutes.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This lesson can be extended to include not only impossible graphs, but also non-function
      graphs (those that do not pass the vertical line test).
    </li>
    <li>
      This lesson can be extended to include having each team of students discuss a situation in
      which the impossible graph could be possible. This is a good place to discuss how time is not
      the only possible independent variable.

    content: "<p>
  Remind students what has been learned in previous lessons that will be pertinent to this lesson
  and/or have them begin to think about the words and ideas of this lesson:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask the students if they remember how to read graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide them with several graphs and ask them to interpret them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Draw a graph on the board for example distance covered in (x)amount of time. Place a break in
      the graph making it an impossible graph and ask the students if they can explain what is
      \"wrong\" with it.
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about impossible graphs and how to determine if a graph is
      impossible.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about impossible graphs , but please do not turn
      your computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.
    </li>
  </ul>

      Next have a \"live\" discussion while going through the

      You may wish to bring the class back together for a discussion of the findings. Once the
      students have been allowed to share what they found, summarize the results of the lesson.
