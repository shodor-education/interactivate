abstract: "<p>
  Make learning how to estimate fun by using Shodor's computer applets. This lesson combines the use
  of four different computer estimation applets with several classroom estimation activities.
  Students can estimate arithmetic expressions, counting objects, length, and area.

  <ul>
    <li>
      After the students have had a chance to write down their guess, have them raise their hands,
      so that you can call on a few students to explain the method they used to formulate their
      guess.
    </li>
    <li>
      The teacher should know the correct answers and hone in on those students giving the correct
      answers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expand on students' methods and explain that these are forms of estimation.
    </li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Have some pre-drawn or pre-taped shapes located around the room.

    <li>
      Have the students estimate the area of each shape in square ft and in square cm.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have the students open the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/MoreOrLessEstimator' | relative_url }}\">More or Less Estimator</a> applet

    <li>
      Work through a few problems as a class, so that students can become familiar with the applet.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Have the students take turns using the

    </li>
    <li>
      Once the students have had time to become proficient with the More or Less Estimator applet
      have them work with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ComparisonEstimator' | relative_url }}\">Comparison Estimator</a> applet for about five minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next have the students work with the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/Estimator' | relative_url }}\">Estimator</a> applet for five minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally have the class spend five minutes playing
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/EstimatorFour' | relative_url }}\">Estimator Four</a> applet.

    <li>
      To ensure the students are on task you can circulate through the room monitoring their
      progress.

      You may also want to have the students copy a problem from each applet that they found
      challenging.
