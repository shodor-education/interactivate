abstract: "<p>
  This lesson is designed to continue the discussion of fractals started in the , and lessons.
  Students are introduced to the notion of irregular fractals and given an idea of the difficulty
  involved in calculating the fractal dimension as outlined in the lesson.

  This lesson can be rearranged in several ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do only one activity -- the flake maker makes more interesting fractal pictures.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the additional task of trying to build an image that looks like an actual object with
      flake maker. Some suggestions: mountain ranges, ocean waves, flowers, animals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a contest in which the students are asked to find the most interesting image, with a
      panel of teachers or the entire class being the judge. (Have the students print out their
      images so that a display can be set up.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If connected to the internet, use the enhanced version of the software,
      <link href=\"http://shodor.org/master/fractal/software/Snowflake.html\">Snowflake</a>, to explore line deformation fractals more fully.

  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:

    <li>
      Today, class, we are going to learn about fractals.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use the computers to learn about fractals, but please do not turn your
      computers on until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this activity first.

objectives:
  - "have learned about irregular fractals and built a few"
  - "have practiced their pattern recognition skills"
  - "have practiced their plane geometry skills"

suggested-follow-up: "<p>
  After these discussions and activities, the students will have seen how complex fractals can be
  generated by generalizing the ideas for making regular fractals, introduced in the
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/GeometricFractals' | relative_url }}\">Geometric Fractals</a> and
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/FractalsAndTheChaos' | relative_url }}\">Fractals and Chaos Game</a> lessons. The next lesson,
  <a href=\"{{ '/lessons/TheMandelbrotSet' | relative_url }}\">The Mandelbrot Set</a>, is a cap-stone activity, designed to introduce the student to the most celebrated modern fractal
  object, the Mandelbrot set.
