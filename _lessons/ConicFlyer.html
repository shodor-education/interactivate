  If students are already familiar with the equations for conic sections, this lesson can be
  rearranged in the following way:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Start by solving the equation of each conic section for
      <em>y</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how these solved equations relate to the distance formula.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discuss how the geometric interpretation of each conic section is equivalent to the algebraic
      interpretation.
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  Remind students of information they have learned in previous lessons that is relevant to the task
  at hand.
</p>
<p>
  Ask the following opening questions:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What is the geometric definition of a circle, ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola?
    </li>
    <li>
      How are all of these definitions related?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is there a way to convert these geometric definitions into algebraic equations?
    </li>
  </ul>

    content: "<p>
  Let the students know what it is they will be doing and learning today. Say something like this:
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Today, we are going to learn how to derive the algebraic definitions of conic sections from
      their geometric definitions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are going to use computers to visualize these conic sections, but please do not turn your
      computers on or go to this website until I ask you to. I want to show you a little about this
      first.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>"
  - heading: "Teacher Input"
    content: "<p>
  Introduce the derivation of conic sections by leading the class in a
  <a href=\"{{ '/discussions/ConicDerivation' | relative_url }}\">discussion</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If students have trouble with the concept, review the distance formula and the geometric
  definitions of a circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola.

  - heading: "Guided Practice"
    content: "<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Bring up the
      <a href=\"{{ '/activities/ConicFlyer' | relative_url }}\">Conic Flyer</a> activity on an overhead or LCD projector to demonstrate how the activity works.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explain how manipulating the sliders at the bottom alters the layout of the graph by changing
      the equation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work through at least one example problem with the class:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Start with an equation with values for
          <em>h</em>,
          <em>k</em>, and
          <em>r</em> already defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Substitute into the equation values for
          <em>x</em> to find the corresponding values for
          <em>y</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plot the points on graph paper and draw a conic section connecting them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Graph the same conic section using Conic Flyer to check your work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  - heading: "Independent Practice"
    content: "<p>
  Have students work in pairs to sketch their predictions of the graphs of the equations on the
  <a href=\"{{ '/media/worksheets/Conic_Flyer_Worksheet' | relative_url }}\">worksheet</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When each group finishes estimating, have them calculate a few points on each graph to check their
  work.
</p>
<p>
  When each group has estimated and plotted points for
  <em>all</em> graphs, allow them to check their work using Conic Flyer.

    content: "<p>
  As a class, discuss the findings of the lesson.
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Review the questions on the worksheet and compare results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students if they can now derive equations of conic sections from their geometric
      definitions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review the geometric functions of
      <em>h</em>,
      <em>k</em>,
      <em>a</em>,
      <em>b</em>, and
      <em>r</em> in the conic equations.
